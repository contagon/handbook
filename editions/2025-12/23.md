# 23. Sharing the Gospel and Strengthening New and Returning Members

## 23.0 Introduction

Inviting all to receive the gospel is part of God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see [1.2](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#12-gods-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation) in this handbook; [Matthew 28:19–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)). It includes:

* Participating in missionary work and serving as missionaries.
* Helping new and returning Church members progress along the covenant path.

## 23.1 Share the Gospel

Jesus Christ loves us. He shares His gospel with us and invites all to come unto Him. We can do the same.

2:33

### 23.1.1 Love

We are all children of Heavenly Father, who loves His children perfectly. He offers everyone the opportunity to be filled with His love through Jesus Christ and His gospel (see [John 3:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16); [2 Nephi 26:24–28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24-p28#p24); [Alma 26:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p37#p37); [Articles of Faith 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)).

One way we show our love for God is by loving and serving His children as Jesus Christ did (see [Matthew 22:36–39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?lang=eng&id=p36-p39#p36); [25:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)). This love inspires us to meet those around us and reach out to people of all backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs (see [Acts 10:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34); [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p33#p33); [Jacob 2:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)). We pray for and seek opportunities to share the gospel with others (see [Alma 6:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6?lang=eng&id=p6#p6); [8:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)).

### 23.1.2 Share

Because we love God and His children, we naturally want to share the blessings He has given us (see [John 13:34–35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng&id=p34-p35#p34)) and help gather Israel. We seek to help people feel the joy that we feel (see [Alma 36:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). As disciples of Jesus Christ, we hold up His light (see [3 Nephi 18:24–25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p24-p25#p24)). We speak openly of the Savior and His influence in our lives (see [Doctrine and Covenants 60:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)).

We share love, gospel truths, time, experiences, and Church programs to bless God’s children and help them draw closer to the Savior. We share these things in normal and natural ways as part of personal, online, and other interactions.

Wards and stakes can create natural opportunities for members to share with others. One way to do this is to host events and activities. For more information, see “[Share Ward Activities](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/share-ward-activities-2025/01-share-ward-activities?lang=eng)” in Gospel Library.

Ward and stake leaders also counsel together to identify (1) needs in the local community and (2) Church resources to share to help meet those needs. For more information, see “[Share Church Resources](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/sharing-church-resources?lang=eng)” in the Gospel Library.

### 23.1.3 Invite

The Savior invites all to receive His gospel and prepare for eternal life (see [Alma 5:33–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p33-p34#p33)). As His disciples, we follow His example, inviting all to “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” ([Moroni 10:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)).

We pray for inspiration and guidance on how to invite others to:

* Come and see the blessings available through Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church (see [John 1:37–39, 45–46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p37-p39,p45-p46#p37)).
* Come and serve people in need.
* Come and belong to the restored Church of Jesus Christ.

Often, inviting simply means including our family, friends, and neighbors in what we are already doing. For example, consider inviting people based on their needs and interests to:

* Sacrament meetings and other Sunday meetings. One of the most valuable experiences we can offer others is attending sacrament meeting together and helping them have a welcoming, spiritual experience (see [3 Nephi 18:22–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p22-p23#p22)).
* Special Church events, such as baby blessings or baptisms.
* Ward and stake activities, including Primary and youth activities (see “[Share Ward Activities](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/share-ward-activities-2025/01-share-ward-activities?lang=eng)” in Gospel Library).
* Activities in our homes.
* Church programs, such as seminary, institute, family history, self-reliance classes, and [JustServe.org](https://www.justserve.org) projects (where available).
* Lessons with the missionaries.

For more ideas and resources, see:

* [share.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/share).
* “[Sharing the Gospel](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/sharing-the-gospel?lang=eng)” in the Gospel Library.
* The “[Unite with Members](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/17-chapter-9?lang=eng&id=title16-figure8_p3#title16)” section in chapter 9 of Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

As we love, share, and invite as Christ did, God will place opportunities in our path (see [Doctrine and Covenants 11:3–5, 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng&id=p3-p5,p8#p3)). Any effort to live the principles of love, share, and invite is positive, whether or not a person meets with the missionaries or joins the Church.

The principles of loving, sharing, and inviting apply also to strengthening new and returning members.

2:46

## 23.2 Strengthen New Members

Joining the Church is both wonderful and challenging for many. It brings great blessings, but it also requires adjusting to new beliefs, new habits, and new relationships (see [1 Thessalonians 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)).

Each new member needs friendship, opportunities to serve, and spiritual nourishment. As members of the Church, we give new members our love and support (see [Mosiah 18:8–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)). We help them feel a sense of belonging in the Church. We help them progress along the [covenant path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/my-covenant-path?lang=eng) (see [23.4.1](23.md#2341-my-covenant-path-and-covenant-path-progress-report)) and become more deeply “converted unto the Lord” ([Alma 23:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)). We help them be “nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, … relying alone upon the merits of Christ” ([Moroni 6:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)).

We can also help new members:

* Learn and experience the joy of being a disciple of Jesus Christ.
* Learn how to recognize promptings from the Spirit.
* Develop a habit of personal and family prayer and scripture study.
* Share the gospel with their family and friends.
* Find names of ancestors and prepare to receive temple ordinances for them (see [25.4](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#254-family-history-resources)).
* Grow through fulfilling Church assignments and participating in the many other opportunities the Church offers.

## 23.3 Strengthen Returning Members

Some members choose to stop participating in the Church. “Unto such,” said the Savior, “shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them” ([3 Nephi 18:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)). These words apply to all who, for any reason, need continued ministering.

Members who are not fully participating are more likely to return if they have strong relationships with Church members. Our love and support can help them overcome challenges. Like new members, they need friendship, opportunities to serve, and spiritual nourishment. Understanding their circumstances and challenges can help us minister to them with sensitivity and love.

## 23.4 Hold Weekly Missionary Coordination Meetings

Every week, brief informal meetings are held to coordinate efforts to share the gospel. The purpose of these meetings is to help those being taught, new members, and returning members to make and keep covenants. If a ward mission leader is called, he conducts these meetings. Otherwise, the member of the elders quorum presidency who fills the role of ward mission leader conducts.

Others who are invited include:

* Assigned members of the Relief Society, elders quorum, and Primary presidencies.
* Ward missionaries.
* An assistant in the priests quorum (or the teachers or deacons quorum president if there are no priests in the ward).
* A presidency member of the oldest Young Women class.
* Full-time missionaries.

Weekly missionary coordination meetings focus on the needs of individuals. The agenda usually includes the following items:

* How to help those being taught by the missionaries
* How to help those who were recently baptized
* How to help part-member families and returning members
* How to find more people to teach

The [Covenant Path Progress report](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/strengthening-new-and-returning-members/strengthening-new-and-returning-members?lang=eng&id=title4-p43#title4), suggestions in the “[Weekly Coordination Meetings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/sharing-the-gospel-resources-for-leaders/02-effective-coordination-with-missionaries?lang=eng)” section in chapter 13 of Preach My Gospel, and the questions below can help guide weekly plans.

* How can we help individuals attend church, have an uplifting experience, and build friendships?
* How can we support the ward plan for sharing the gospel?
* How can the ward council help, and who will coordinate with them?

These meetings may be held in person or remotely. Coordination can also happen in other ways, including phone calls or group texts.

Strive to follow the principles of action and accountability in [4.4.5](4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ.md#445-action-and-accountability). A person in the meeting may be assigned to record and remind the group of planned actions.

[[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources)Small branches may choose to do their weekly coordination in the branch council.

See a sample meeting agenda and other coordination examples in “[Ideas for Weekly Missionary Coordination](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/sharing-the-gospel-resources-for-leaders/02-effective-coordination-with-missionaries?lang=eng)” in Gospel Library.

### 23.4.1 My Covenant Path and Covenant Path Progress Report

The following resources can help guide discussions during weekly missionary coordination meetings:

* [My Covenant Path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/adults/new-or-returning-members?lang=eng). This resource helps new and returning members progress along the covenant path during the first 12 to 24 months after baptism or after returning to gospel participation. [My Covenant Path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/adults/new-or-returning-members?lang=eng) is available in Gospel Library.
* [Covenant Path Progress report](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/strengthening-new-and-returning-members/strengthening-new-and-returning-members?lang=eng&id=title4-p43#title4). Ward leaders use this resource to record and view the progress of new and returning members and of people being taught by the missionaries. Covenant Path Progress can be seen and updated by ward leaders through the Member Tools app and [Leader and Clerk Resources](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) (LCR). Full-time missionaries access and update Covenant Path Progress through the Preach My Gospel app.

2:9

## 23.5 Stake Leaders

### 23.5.1 Stake Presidency

The stake president holds the keys in the stake for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. He and his counselors give overall direction for these efforts. He ensures that this work is discussed regularly in stake meetings.

Usually monthly, the stake president meets with the mission president to coordinate efforts between the stake and ward leaders and the full-time missionaries. Others who may attend include:

* Counselors in the stake and mission presidencies.
* Assigned high councilors.
* The stake Relief Society president.
* Missionaries assigned by the mission president.

### 23.5.2 Stake Adult Leadership Committee

The stake adult leadership committee includes:

* The stake presidency.
* The stake Relief Society presidency.
* High councilors assigned to work with elders quorums.

These leaders instruct and support elders quorum and ward Relief Society presidencies in their efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see [23.6.2](23.md#2362-elders-quorum-and-relief-society-presidencies)). Instruction could take place in a group setting or individually. Ward mission leaders may be invited to receive this instruction.

For more about this committee’s meetings, see [29.3.8](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#2938-ao-stake-adult-leadership-committee-meeting).

### 23.5.3 High Councilors

The stake presidency may assign high councilors to instruct and support elders quorum presidencies and ward mission leaders. One or more high councilors may be assigned to lead these efforts. However, all high councilors have these responsibilities for the wards and quorums to which they are assigned.

### 23.5.4 Stake Relief Society Presidency

Under the direction of the stake president, the stake Relief Society presidency instructs and supports ward Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.

## 23.6 Ward Leaders

### 23.6.1 Bishopric

The bishopric coordinates with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s efforts in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. These leaders counsel together regularly.

The bishopric ensures that these efforts are discussed and coordinated in ward council and ward youth council meetings. The bishopric also reviews and approves the ward plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](23.md#2366-ward-plan-for-sharing-the-gospel-and-strengthening-new-and-returning-members)).

[[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) The bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward mission leader (see [23.6.3](23.md#2363-ao-ward-mission-leader) for more information).

The bishop interviews new members who are old enough to receive a temple recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations (see [26.5.1](26-temple-recommends.md#2651-newly-baptized-members)). He also interviews brethren of the appropriate age to receive the Aaronic Priesthood (see [38.2.9.1](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38291-new-members)). He can accomplish both purposes in the same interview. He normally conducts this interview within a week of the member’s confirmation. A bishop or branch president may assign one of his counselors to conduct this interview. Afterward, the bishop may offer to use Family Name Assist to help the new member print the name of a deceased family member for whom the new member can perform temple ordinances (see “[Family Name Assist](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/25-temple-and-family-history-work?lang=eng&id=p_j0Z9o#p_j0Z9o)” in 25.4.1).

The bishopric coordinates with other leaders to ensure that new and returning members have opportunities to serve. Such opportunities can help these members grow spiritually and feel the Lord’s power in their lives. Service can also help members feel joy and build close relationships with others in the ward.

Service opportunities should be based on the member’s needs and abilities. In some cases, a calling is appropriate. In others, a less formal assignment is best.

### 23.6.2 Elders Quorum and Relief Society Presidencies

The elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies lead the ward’s day-to-day efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see [8.2.3](8-elders-quorum.md#823-inviting-all-to-receive-the-gospel) and [9.2.3](9-relief-society.md#923-inviting-all-to-receive-the-gospel)). The elders quorum presidency leads these efforts for members of the elders quorum. The Relief Society presidency leads the efforts for members of the Relief Society. They work together to lead these efforts with the ward council, under the coordination of the bishop.

These leaders have the following responsibilities:

* Help inspire members to love God’s children, to share the gospel, and to invite others to receive the Savior’s blessings (see [23.1](23.md#231-share-the-gospel)).
* Counsel with quorum or Relief Society members about how to share the gospel. Discuss how to find people for the missionaries to teach and how to support people who are being taught. Counsel together about the needs of new and returning members and how to provide support.
* Assign ministering brothers and sisters to new and returning members (see [21.2.1](21-ministering.md#2121-making-assignments)). Ministering brothers and sisters may also be assigned to people the missionaries are teaching (this is done in coordination with the missionaries). If possible, leaders assign members who have or can develop close friendships with these individuals. Leaders encourage ministering brothers and sisters to give Christlike love and support.
* Give new and returning members opportunities to serve as ministering sisters or brothers. For more about ministering, see [chapter 21](21-ministering.md).
* Help the ward council develop a plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](23.md#2366-ward-plan-for-sharing-the-gospel-and-strengthening-new-and-returning-members)).
* Lead the work of the ward mission leader. If this leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role (see [23.6.3](23.md#2363-ao-ward-mission-leader)).

The elders quorum president and Relief Society president each assign a presidency member to help lead these efforts. These two presidency members work together. They attend weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](23.md#234-hold-weekly-missionary-coordination-meetings)).

### 23.6.3 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Ward Mission Leader

The bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward mission leader. If they decide to extend this calling, the bishopric counsels with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents in determining whom to call.

The ward mission leader should be a Melchizedek Priesthood holder. If a ward mission leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role.

The ward mission leader supports the elders quorum presidency and Relief Society presidency in their missionary responsibilities. He also has the following responsibilities:

* Coordinate the work of ward members and leaders, ward missionaries, and full-time missionaries. This may include coordinating teaching efforts, baptismal services, and efforts to strengthen new members. It can also include planning ways to help ward members share the gospel.
* Lead weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](23.md#234-hold-weekly-missionary-coordination-meetings)).
* Attend ward council meetings when invited.
* Help the ward council develop and implement the ward plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](23.md#2366-ward-plan-for-sharing-the-gospel-and-strengthening-new-and-returning-members)).
* Seek opportunities to help full-time missionaries fulfill their purpose by sharing the gospel and building relationships with members. Where approved, this may include eating meals with members (preferably with part-member families and new and returning members when possible; see [24.6.2.3](24.md#24623-housing-meals-and-transportation)).
* Work with the ward temple and family history leader and consultants to help those who are learning the gospel, new members, and returning members engage in temple and family history efforts.

### 23.6.4 Ward Missionaries

Ward missionaries help ward members experience the joy of sharing the gospel as described in [23.1](23.md#231-share-the-gospel). They serve under the direction of the ward mission leader or the member of the elders quorum presidency who fills this role. The elders quorum and Relief Society presidents may suggest members who could serve.

Ward missionaries teach by word and example how to love others, share their faith, and invite others to receive the blessings of the gospel. They also help ward members minister to new and returning members.

Ward missionaries participate in weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](23.md#234-hold-weekly-missionary-coordination-meetings)).

### 23.6.5 Ward Council and Ward Youth Council

Sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members should be discussed regularly in ward council meetings. The bishop may ask the ward mission leader (or the member of the elders quorum presidency who fills this role), elders quorum president, or Relief Society president to lead these discussions. (See [23.4](23.md#234-hold-weekly-missionary-coordination-meetings).)

The council may discuss the ward’s plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. They coordinate assignments across organizations.

Resources like [My Covenant Path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/adults/new-or-returning-members?lang=eng) and the Covenant Path Progress report can help in these discussions (see [23.4.1](23.md#2341-my-covenant-path-and-covenant-path-progress-report)).

For more about the ward council, see [29.2.5](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#2925-ward-council-meeting).

The ward youth council gives special attention to youth who are:

* New and returning members.
* In part-member families.
* Being taught by the missionaries.
* Friends of other faiths or beliefs.

### 23.6.6 Ward Plan for Sharing the Gospel and Strengthening New and Returning Members

Each ward should have a simple plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. This plan can help guide meetings, service, and activities. It can include plans and ideas for:

* Helping everyone feel welcome in ward meetings and activities.
* Helping members experience the joy of sharing the gospel.
* Supporting people being taught by the missionaries.
* Helping new and returning members progress spiritually.

The elders quorum and Relief Society presidents help the ward council create the plan. The ward mission leader also helps. The bishop reviews and approves it.

Members of the ward council take the lead in implementing the plan. They report on progress in ward council meetings. They also update the plan as needed.
