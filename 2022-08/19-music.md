# 19. Music

## 19.1 Purpose of Music in the Church

In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said, “My soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” ([Doctrine and Covenants 25:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.12?lang=eng#p12)). He also said, “The righteous … shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy” ([Doctrine and Covenants 45:71](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.71?lang=eng#p71)).

Sacred music increases faith in Jesus Christ. It invites the Spirit and teaches doctrine. It also creates a feeling of reverence, unifies members, and provides a way to worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

## 19.2 Music in the Home

Through His prophets, the Lord has encouraged individuals and families to use uplifting music in their daily lives. Singing and listening to sacred music can invite a spirit of beauty and peace. It can also increase love and unity among family members. The hymns can help individuals gain courage and withstand temptation.

Recordings of Church music are available from the following sources:

* Sacred Music app
* Gospel Library app
* [Music.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music)
* CDs at [store.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://store.churchofjesuschrist.org)

The Church provides resources to help individuals and families learn basic music skills. They can be found at [music.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music) (see also [19.6](19-music.md#196-music-training-and-resources)). Developing music skills expands opportunities for members to serve at home and in the Church.

## 19.3 Music in Church Meetings

Sacred music is a vital part of sacrament meeting and other Church meetings. It has power to invite the Spirit, bringing individuals closer to God. “Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns.” (See Hymns, [ix](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/guidelines/first-presidency-preface-to-the-hymns).)

### 19.3.1 Planning Music for Church Meetings

Ward and stake music coordinators work with priesthood leaders to plan music for worship services. They select music that enhances the spirit of worship in the meetings.

Hymns are used for all congregational singing in worship services. Hymns or other sacred musical selections may be used for prelude and postlude music, choir music, and solo or small group presentations. All music in Church meetings should be presented in the spirit of worship of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, not as a performance to showcase musical talent.

Musical selections should be consistent with the worshipful spirit of the hymns. They should teach the gospel with power and clarity.

Sacred music that is written or sung in culturally diverse musical styles may help unify congregations. Music coordinators and priesthood leaders may include a variety of appropriate musical styles that appeal to members of various backgrounds.

### 19.3.2 Music in Sacrament Meeting

Members gather in sacrament meeting to remember Jesus Christ by partaking of the sacrament. They gather to build faith and testimony and to worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Music should be selected to help achieve these purposes.

Music in sacrament meeting includes congregational singing of hymns to open and close the meeting and before the administration of the sacrament. Congregational hymns provide an opportunity for members to unite as they actively participate in worshipping together. The sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior. For more information, see “[Hymns for Congregations](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/hymns/using-the-hymnbook?lang=eng&para=title8-p19#title8),” Hymns, 380–81.

Prelude music is played as members gather before the meeting. Its purpose is to create an atmosphere of worship that invites the Spirit. After the closing prayer, an instrumental postlude is played as members leave the meeting. Hymns and other sacred music can be selected for prelude and postlude music.

A sacrament meeting could also include an additional congregational hymn sung in the middle of the meeting—for example, between spoken messages. Or it may include one or more other musical selections. These could be presented by choirs (see [19.3.7](19-music.md#1937-choirs)), vocal or instrumental soloists, or small groups. Sacrament meetings should not be turned over to outside musical groups.

The piano, organ, or another instrument approved by the bishopric may be used to accompany hymn singing in sacrament meeting (see [19.3.6](19-music.md#1936-musical-instruments)).

Music coordinators and bishoprics try to find a balance between familiar and less-familiar hymns. Musical selections presented by the ward choir or others can help members become more familiar with hymns that are not as well known.

### 19.3.3 Music in Classes and Other Ward Meetings

Singing hymns can be an effective way to introduce or reinforce gospel principles. Leaders encourage teachers to use the hymns and other sacred music to enhance their teaching.

Sunday quorum meetings and classes do not routinely begin with an opening hymn.

### 19.3.4 Music in Stake Conference

Music for stake conference should be planned to strengthen faith and testimony. It should follow the principles in [19.3.1](19-music.md#1931-planning-music-for-church-meetings). The presiding authority reviews all proposed musical selections early in the planning.

Music for stake conference usually includes congregational hymn singing and other musical selections from a choir, soloists, or small groups. The congregation normally sings a hymn at the midpoint of the meeting. Stake presidencies may approve solo and accompanying instruments other than the piano or organ (see [19.3.6](19-music.md#1936-musical-instruments)).

### 19.3.5 Other Music in the Chapel

The chapel may occasionally be used for cultural arts events that include secular music, such as concerts, recitals, and other presentations. While applause is discouraged in worship services, it may be appropriate for these events.

Local priesthood leaders answer questions about cultural activities held in the chapel. See [35.5](35.md#355-policies-on-using-church-property) for information about the appropriate use of meetinghouses.

### 19.3.6 Musical Instruments

Live instruments are normally used for prelude and postlude music and for hymn accompaniment in Church meetings. Where they are available and where members can play them, organs and pianos are the standard instruments. Bishoprics may approve the use of other instruments to accompany congregational singing, for prelude and postlude music, and in other musical selections.

Musical instruments should convey a feeling of worship and be played in keeping with the spirit of the meeting.

[[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) If a piano, organ, or accompanist is not available, recordings may be used (see [19.2](19-music.md#192-music-in-the-home)).

#### 19.3.6.1 Obtaining Musical Instruments

Church buildings are usually supplied with an organ, pianos, or electronic keyboards. Leaders may contact the local facilities manager for information about acquiring new or replacement instruments.

#### 19.3.6.2 Maintaining Musical Instruments

Pianos are tuned and organs are maintained regularly. The bishop or the stake building representative can contact the facilities manager with questions. As needed, he can also submit a request in Facility Issue Reporting (FIR) to maintain and repair pianos and organs (see [35.4.2](35.md#3542-requesting-repairs)).

### 19.3.7 Choirs

Since Old Testament times, God’s children have sung in choirs to offer praise to Him. Church choirs bring glory to God, unify and edify Church members, and bring joy to participants and congregations.

#### 19.3.7.1 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Ward Choirs

Where there are enough members, wards may organize choirs that sing in sacrament meeting regularly. The bishopric may call a choir director and choir accompanist (see [19.4.3.3](19-music.md#19433-choir-director-and-choir-accompanist)).

Ward members may volunteer to sing in the choir. Members and others may also be invited to participate. Auditions are not held.

Choirs are encouraged to use the hymns of the Church. The singing of hymns invites the Spirit and helps choir participants and congregations learn the gospel (see Hymns, [381–83](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/hymns/using-the-hymnbook?lang=eng&para=title15-figure3#title15)). If other sacred musical selections are used, the guidelines in [19.3.1](19-music.md#1931-planning-music-for-church-meetings) should be followed.

Choir rehearsals do not usually exceed one hour.

If the ward choir needs sheet music, it may be purchased with ward budget funds (see [19.7.1](19-music.md#1971-obtaining-and-using-music)). Ward choirs are encouraged to share purchased music with other choirs in the stake. Duplicating sheet music without permission from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy (see [38.8.11](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38811-copyrighted-materials)).

In addition to the ward choir, families and groups of women, men, youth, or children may be invited to sing in Church meetings.

#### 19.3.7.2 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Stake and Multistake Choirs

With the approval of stake or area leaders, stake and multistake choirs may be organized for stake conferences and other occasions, such as community events. After the meeting or event, the choir is disbanded until other occasions arise.
