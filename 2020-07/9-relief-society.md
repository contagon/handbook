# 9. Relief Society

## 9.1 Purpose and Organization

Relief Society helps God’s children prepare to return to His presence. As daughters of heavenly parents, members of Relief Society “expound scriptures,” “exhort the church,” lift hearts, and “cleave unto the covenants [they have] made” ([Doctrine and Covenants 25:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.7?lang=eng#p7), [13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.13?lang=eng#p13)).

### 9.1.1 Purpose

Relief Society is a divinely instituted organization for all adult women in the Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the purpose of Relief Society is to save souls and relieve suffering. He stated that the Church of Jesus Christ was not fully organized until the sisters were so organized.

Members of Relief Society work together to help accomplish the work of salvation and exaltation. They serve others, fulfill covenant responsibilities, build unity, and learn and live doctrine.

The motto of Relief Society is “Charity never faileth” ([1 Corinthians 13:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.8?lang=eng#p8)). This motto is reflected in the Relief Society’s seal.

### 9.1.2 Membership in Relief Society

Relief Society is a lifelong sisterhood. All adult sisters 18 and older are members of Relief Society. They are members even if they cannot attend Relief Society meetings.

A young woman may begin attending Relief Society when she turns 18. She counsels with her parents and bishop about the timing. By age 19 or when moving from home, such as to attend a university or serve a mission, she should participate in Relief Society.

Married women under 18 are also members of Relief Society.

For information about unwed parents under age 18, see [38.1.5](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#3815-unwed-parents-under-age-18).

### 9.1.3 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources)Adapting to Local Needs

Some wards have a very large number of active adult women. For these wards, the bishop and stake president may authorize having more than one ward Relief Society. Each Relief Society has its own presidency. If possible, each Relief Society should have members with a variety of ages and experience.

## 9.2 Participating in the Work of Salvation and Exaltation

God invites all to come unto Christ and participate in the work of salvation and exaltation by:

* Living the gospel of Jesus Christ.
* Caring for those in need.
* Inviting all to receive the gospel.
* Uniting families for eternity.

Relief Society leaders plan Sunday meetings, activities, ministering, service, and other interactions to help women participate in the work of salvation and exaltation. Members of the Relief Society and elders quorum work in unity to accomplish this work.

For more information about the work of salvation and exaltation, study [chapter 1](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md).

### 9.2.1 Living the Gospel of Jesus Christ

Relief Society leaders support members in living the gospel of Jesus Christ. They emphasize exercising faith, repenting, increasing in self-reliance, and making covenants with God by receiving ordinances. Such ordinances include the temple endowment. See [1.2.1](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#121-living-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ).

#### 9.2.1.1 Gospel Learning at Home

When members learn and live the gospel at home, their conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ deepens. Relief Society leaders encourage sisters to study the scriptures and the words of living prophets, individually and with their families. [Come, Follow Me﻿—For Individuals and Families](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/come-follow-me) and other resources can supplement their study.

Home evenings are an important way to learn the gospel at home. They are usually held weekly on Sunday, on Monday evening, or at another time. They could include prayers, gospel study, testimonies, singing, and fun activities.

#### 9.2.1.2 Gospel Learning in Relief Society Meetings

Relief Societies meet on Sundays for the following purposes:

* Strengthen faith.
* Build unity.
* Strengthen families and homes.
* Make plans to help accomplish the work of salvation and exaltation.

Meetings are held on the second and fourth Sundays of the month. They last 50 minutes. The Relief Society presidency plans these meetings. A member of the presidency conducts.

The meeting begins with a presidency member conducting any business. For example, the sisters may counsel together about aspects of accomplishing the work of salvation and exaltation. Sufficient time should then be given to meaningful gospel instruction and discussion.

Relief Society meetings focus on topics in one or more talks from the most recent general conference. The Relief Society presidency prayerfully selects messages to discuss based on sisters’ needs. Hymns may be sung to enhance a lesson. Meetings should end with a prayer.

For more information, see [ComeFollowMe.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/come-follow-me).

#### 9.2.1.3 Activities

Relief Society presidencies may plan activities. These activities strengthen sisters and give them opportunities to serve together. Most activities are held at times other than on Sundays or Monday evenings.

The Relief Society president oversees these activities. She may ask a counselor or another sister to take the lead in planning and carrying them out (see [9.3.4](9-relief-society.md#934-additional-callings)). Presidencies discuss activities with the bishop as part of their planning.

### 9.2.2 Caring for Those in Need

As followers of Jesus Christ, sisters have a responsibility to reach out in love to those in need. Individually and as a Relief Society, they seek ways to serve others in the ward and community. Where available, [JustServe.org](http://www.justserve.org) suggests community service opportunities.

For more information about how members of the Relief Society and elders quorum care for those in need, see [22.2.4](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#2224-elders-quorum-and-relief-society).

#### 9.2.2.1 Ministering

Ministering is caring for others as the Savior would. Sisters receive ministering assignments from the Relief Society presidency. For more information, see [chapter 21](21-ministering.md).

#### 9.2.2.2 Short-Term Needs

Ministering sisters seek to understand and respond to the needs of those they serve. Members may need short-term assistance at times of illness, births, deaths, job loss, and other circumstances.

When needed, ministering sisters ask the Relief Society presidency for help. The presidency may recommend calling a service coordinator to organize these efforts (see [9.3.4](9-relief-society.md#934-additional-callings)).

The Relief Society and elders quorum coordinate efforts to address short-term needs (see [22.2.4.1](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#22241-short-term-welfare-needs)). The bishop may provide fast-offering assistance if needed.

In some locations, bishops have the option to provide members in need with a bishop’s order for food and other basic goods. The bishop generally assigns the Relief Society president to meet with the members and fill out the order form. However, he may also assign the elders quorum president. A counselor in the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency may be assigned if the president is unavailable. The assigned leader submits the completed form to the bishop for his approval.

For more information, see [22.6.4.3](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#22643-relief-society-president) and “[Welfare Resources](http://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org)” in Leader and Clerk Resources.

#### 9.2.2.3 Long-Term Needs and Self-Reliance

Under the bishop’s direction, the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies help members with long-term needs and self-reliance. They teach principles of temporal and spiritual self-reliance. See [chapter 22](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md) and “[Self-Reliance](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/life-help/self-reliance?lang=eng)” in the Gospel Library app.

If a person or family needs assistance, the Relief Society and elders quorum presidents counsel together under the direction of the bishop about how to help (see [22.6.3](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#2263-principles-and-guidelines-for-rendering-assistance)).

The Relief Society president, elders quorum president, or another leader helps the person or family develop a [Self-Reliance Plan](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/welfare/PD60007387_000_SelfReliancePlan_Member_Web_Interactive.pdf). Ministering sisters or brothers can also help with the plan. Often, other members of the Relief Society or elders quorum have skills or experience that can help. All who assist treat information with confidentiality. For more information, see [22.2.4.2](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#22242-long-term-welfare-needs) and [22.2.4.5](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md#22245-seeking-service-from-the-elders-quorum-relief-society-and-others).

#### 9.2.2.4 When a Ward Member Dies

When a ward member dies, Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies offer comfort and assistance. Under the direction of the bishop, they can help with the funeral.

If possible, deceased members who were endowed are buried in temple clothing. The bishop may ask the Relief Society president to assign an endowed sister to dress or oversee the dressing of a deceased endowed sister. For more information, see [27.3.9](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2739-temple-burial-clothing).

Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies, ministering brothers and sisters, and others continue to offer comfort and assistance after the funeral.

### 9.2.3 Inviting All to Receive the Gospel

Members of Relief Society have a responsibility to invite all to receive the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see [Mosiah 18:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9?lang=eng#p9)). They do this by sharing the gospel, strengthening new members, and reaching out to those who are less active.

In presidency and Relief Society meetings, the Relief Society presidency discusses ways the sisters can invite all to receive the blessings of the gospel.

The Relief Society president assigns a member of the presidency to help lead member missionary work in the ward. She works with the assigned member of the elders quorum presidency to coordinate these efforts (see [23.1.1](23.md#2311-love)).

The assigned member of the Relief Society presidency participates in brief, informal discussions to coordinate inviting all to receive the blessings of the gospel. These discussions are held weekly. They are led by the assigned member of the elders quorum presidency and the ward mission leader (if called). They also include ward missionaries, an assistant in the priests quorum, a presidency member of the oldest Young Women class, and full-time missionaries.

### 9.2.4 Uniting Families for Eternity

Members of Relief Society support members in uniting families for eternity. This includes:

* Making covenants with God by receiving ordinances, including the temple endowment.
* Doing temple and family history work (see [1.2.4](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#124-uniting-families-for-eternity)).

In presidency and Relief Society meetings, the Relief Society presidency discusses ways the sisters can participate in these efforts.

The presidency encourages sisters to learn about their family history and about temple covenants and ordinances. They also encourage sisters to attend the temple regularly where possible.

The Relief Society president assigns a member of the presidency to help lead temple and family history work in the ward. She works with the assigned member of the elders quorum presidency to coordinate these efforts (see [25.4.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2541-elders-quorum-presidency-and-ward-temple-and-family-history-leader)).

The assigned member of the Relief Society presidency participates in brief, informal discussions to coordinate temple and family history work. These discussions are held regularly. They are led by the assigned member of the elders quorum presidency and the ward temple and family history leader (if called). They also include an assistant in the priests quorum, a presidency member of the oldest Young Women class, and temple and family history consultants.

## 9.3 Relief Society Leaders

### 9.3.1 Bishop

The bishop usually meets with the Relief Society president monthly. They discuss the work of salvation and exaltation, including the service of ministering sisters. They also discuss (1) the progress and needs of sisters in the ward and (2) Relief Society meetings, instruction, and activities.

### 9.3.2 Relief Society Presidency

#### 9.3.2.1 Calling a Relief Society Presidency

The bishop calls a woman to serve as the ward Relief Society president. If the unit is large enough, she recommends to him one or two women to serve as her counselors. The bishopric considers her recommendations and extends the callings.

A member of the bishopric presents presidency members in a sacrament meeting for a sustaining vote. The bishop sets apart the Relief Society president. A member of the bishopric sets apart her counselors.

The bishop or one of his counselors presents sisters who are called to other Relief Society callings for a sustaining vote in a Relief Society meeting. See [9.3.3](9-relief-society.md#933-secretary) and [9.3.4](9-relief-society.md#934-additional-callings).

Some small units may not have a Young Women or Primary president. In these units, the Relief Society president may help parents plan instruction for youth and children.

#### 9.3.2.2 Responsibilities

The Relief Society president has the following responsibilities. Her counselors assist her.

* Serve on the ward council. She serves as (1) a member of the council who helps address needs in the ward and find solutions and (2) a representative of the Relief Society (see [7.6.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/7-councils-in-the-church?lang=eng¶=title_number10-p29#title_number10)).
* Lead the Relief Society’s efforts to participate in the work of salvation and exaltation (see [chapter 1](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md)).

The stake Relief Society presidency teaches the ward Relief Society presidency about these responsibilities. They may do this during stake leadership meetings and by visiting ward Relief Society presidency meetings (see [29.3.11](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#29311-stake-leadership-meetings)).

Through her service, the ward Relief Society president supports the bishop in focusing on the youth and on his unique responsibilities.

#### 9.3.2.3 Presidency Meeting

The Relief Society presidency and secretary meet regularly. The president conducts these meetings. The agenda could include the following items:

* Plan how to strengthen sisters and their families.
* Plan how to help accomplish the work of salvation and exaltation.
* Coordinate missionary work and temple and family history work.
* Respond to counsel and assignments from the bishop.
* Respond to assignments from ward council meetings.

* Assistant secretaries to help the Relief Society secretary.
* Ministering secretaries to organize ministering interviews and help prepare quarterly reports.

If these or other callings are needed, the Relief Society presidency recommends sisters to serve. They make these recommendations to the bishopric. If the bishopric approves, a member of the bishopric calls them. He presents them for a sustaining vote in a Relief Society meeting and sets them apart.

As needed, the Relief Society presidency may assign sisters to help with Relief Society efforts in other ways. Sisters with short-term assignments do not need to be called and set apart.

## 9.4 Helping Young Women Prepare to Participate in Relief Society

The Relief Society presidency works with young women, their parents, and Young Women leaders to help young women prepare to participate in Relief Society.

Leaders also provide ongoing opportunities for young women and Relief Society sisters to develop relationships. Serving together as ministering sisters is one valuable way to make connections.

Leaders help young women understand their covenant responsibilities. When it would be helpful to have a young woman minister to a particular sister, she may be assigned as a ministering sister when she is willing, able, and mature. She may be assigned beginning in the year she turns 14. Young women serve as companions to Relief Society sisters (see [21.3](21-ministering.md#213-organizing-ministering-to-meet-local-needs)).

When young adults join Relief Society, the Relief Society presidency gives them opportunities to serve and share their strengths. The presidency also helps them prepare to make and keep sacred temple covenants (see [27.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#271-preparing-to-receive-temple-ordinances)).

## 9.5 Stake Relief Society Leaders

The stake president calls and sets apart a woman to serve as the stake Relief Society president. If a stake is large enough, she recommends one or two women to serve as counselors and another to serve as secretary. These women are called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor. For information about the responsibilities of the stake Relief Society presidency and secretary, see [5.4.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/5-stake-leadership?lang=eng¶=title_number20-p100#title_number20) and [5.4.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/5-stake-leadership?lang=eng¶=title_number21-p88#title_number21).

The stake president meets regularly (usually monthly) with the stake Relief Society president or presidency. They counsel together about the work of salvation and exaltation. They also discuss (1) the progress and needs of sisters in the stake and (2) Relief Society meetings, instruction, and activities.

The stake presidency assigns a high councilor to work with the stake Relief Society presidency (see [5.3.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/5-stake-leadership?lang=eng¶=title_number17-p65#title_number17)).

The stake Relief Society presidency instructs ward Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities for missionary work and temple and family history work. They do this under the direction of the stake presidency. High councilors are assigned to assist. See [23.1](23.md#231-share-the-gospel) and [25.4](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#254-organizing-temple-and-family-history-work-in-the-ward).

If the stake has a young single adult committee, a member of the stake Relief Society presidency serves on it (see [14.3.2](14-single-members.md#1432-stake-young-single-adult-committee)).

## 9.6 Additional Guidelines and Policies

### 9.6.1 Members with Disabilities

The Relief Society presidency gives particular care to members with disabilities. For information about helping these members, see [disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/life/disability) and [38.8.31](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38831-members-with-disabilities).

### 9.6.2 Literacy

As needed, the Relief Society presidency works with the bishop, elders quorum presidency, and ward council to help members learn to read and write.
