# 30. Callings in the Church

## 30.0 Introduction

This chapter provides information about calling and releasing members to serve in the Church. The [Chart of Callings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng¶=title_number13-figure12_note4_p1#title_number13) (30.7) lists selected callings and specifies who recommends a person, who approves the recommendation, who sustains the person, and who calls and sets apart the person. Callings on the chart are filled according to need and as members are available.

## 30.1 Determining Whom to Call

### 30.1.1 General Guidelines

A person must be called of God to serve in the Church (see [Articles of Faith 1:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.5?lang=eng#p5)). Leaders seek the guidance of the Spirit in determining whom to call. They consider the worthiness that may be required for the calling. They also consider the member’s personal or family circumstances. Each calling should benefit the people who are served, the member, and the member’s family.

Although service in Church callings requires sacrifice, it should not compromise a member’s ability to fulfill family and employment responsibilities. Before calling a married person to an assignment that requires a significant time commitment, Church leaders consider the effect of the calling on the marriage and family.

If possible, a member is called to serve in only one calling, in addition to serving as a ministering brother or sister.

Leaders keep information about proposed callings and releases confidential. Only those who need to know, such as an organization president who has responsibility for the person, are informed before the person is presented for a sustaining vote. A person who is being considered for a calling is not notified until the calling is issued.

When a calling will be extended by or under the direction of the stake president, the bishop should be consulted to determine the member’s worthiness and the family, employment, and Church service circumstances. The stake presidency then asks the high council to sustain the decision to call the person, if necessary according to the Chart of Callings.

When a young man or young woman will be called to a Church position, a member of the bishopric obtains approval from the parents or guardians before issuing the calling.

Leaders may extend a Church calling only after (1) a person’s membership record is on file in the ward and has been carefully reviewed by the bishop or (2) the bishop has contacted the member’s previous bishop to determine that the member is worthy for the calling and to verify that his or her membership record does not include an annotation or formal membership restrictions.

New converts should be given an appropriate calling or another responsibility to serve as soon as possible. Some new members may be ready for callings as soon as they are baptized and confirmed. Others may need to receive simple assignments that would help them prepare to receive callings. A member of the bishopric interviews new converts before calling them to teach children or youth.

People who are not members of the Church may be called to some positions, such as organist and music director. However, they should not be called to teaching or administrative positions or as Primary music leaders. The allowance to call nonmembers to some positions does not apply to those whose membership has been withdrawn, who may not have any callings.

### 30.1.2 Recommendations and Approvals for Callings

The Chart of Callings indicates who may make recommendations for each calling and who gives approval. In some cases, priesthood and organization leaders are asked to make recommendations to their stake presidency or bishopric. They should approach this responsibility prayerfully, knowing that they can receive guidance from the Lord about whom to recommend. However, they should remember that final responsibility to receive inspiration on whom to call rests with the stake presidency or the bishopric.

Stake presidents and bishops should carefully evaluate each recommendation, recognizing that it has been prayerfully considered. As needed, they may request another recommendation.

Brethren who are actively serving as sealers in a temple have been called to that responsibility under the direction of the President of the Church. For this reason, active sealers should not be called to serve in any of the following callings: Area Seventy; stake, mission, district, or branch president or bishop; or counselor to any of these.

### 30.1.3 Stake Callings

The stake president oversees the calling of members who serve in most stake positions, as shown in the Chart of Callings.

### 30.1.4 Ward Callings

The stake presidency recommends brethren to be called or released as bishops (see [30.6](30-callings-in-the-church.md#306-calling-ordaining-and-setting-apart-bishops)). The stake president also oversees the calling of counselors in the bishopric, ward clerks, assistant ward clerks, and ward executive secretaries. The bishop oversees other callings in the ward, as shown in the Chart of Callings.

### 30.1.5 Elders Quorum Callings

The stake president oversees the calling of elders quorum presidents and their counselors, as shown in the Chart of Callings.

The elders quorum president oversees the calling of quorum secretaries and those who serve in other elders quorum callings. The bishop’s approval is required before brethren may be called to these positions.

## 30.2 Extending a Calling

The Chart of Callings outlines who may extend each calling. After receiving the necessary approvals, an authorized leader conducts a personal interview to determine the member’s faithfulness and willingness to serve. If the member is willing, the leader extends the calling. The leader may invite the spouse of a married person to be present and give support when the calling is extended.

A leader who extends a Church calling explains its purpose, importance, and responsibilities. He encourages the member to seek the Spirit of the Lord in fulfilling the calling. He tells the member the name of the person to whom he or she is directly accountable and emphasizes the need to support leaders. As needed, he outlines the meetings the person should attend and describes any resource materials that are available. He may identify special concerns or challenges of the calling and invite the member to ask questions about it.

If the calling is to a position that includes working with children or youth, he explains that the member will need to complete children and youth protection training ([ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://protectingchildren.churchofjesuschrist.org)) within one month of being sustained and every three years thereafter.

Leaders ensure that the manner in which they extend a calling is consistent with its sacred nature. Callings should be extended in a dignified, formal manner, not in a casual setting or manner.

## 30.3 Sustaining Members in Church Callings

Members who are called to most Church positions should receive a sustaining vote before they begin serving. The Chart of Callings indicates whether a sustaining vote is needed and what congregation should give it. The leader who oversaw the calling, or a priesthood officer he authorizes, presents a person to the congregation for a sustaining vote.

The person who conducts the sustaining first announces who was released from the position and asks members to give an expression of thanks for the person’s service (see [30.5](30-callings-in-the-church.md#305-releasing-members-from-church-callings) for suggested language).

When presenting a person for a sustaining vote, an authorized priesthood officer asks him or her to stand. The officer may say:

“[Name] has been called as [position], and we propose that he [or she] be sustained. Those in favor may manifest it by the uplifted hand. [Pause briefly for the sustaining vote.] Those opposed, if any, may manifest it. [Pause briefly to allow for a dissenting vote, if any.]”

The person who is being presented should participate in the sustaining vote. If more than one person is being presented, they may usually be sustained as a group.

If a member in good standing gives a dissenting vote when someone is presented to be sustained, the presiding officer or another assigned priesthood officer confers with the dissenting member in private after the meeting. The officer determines whether the dissenting vote was based on knowledge that the person who was presented is guilty of conduct that should disqualify him or her from serving in the position. Dissenting votes from nonmembers need not be considered.

In unusual circumstances, ward members may need to begin service in a calling before they can be presented for a sustaining vote. When this occurs, a member of the bishopric presents them for a ratifying vote as soon as reasonable. He adapts the process outlined above for presenting a person for a sustaining vote. This includes providing an opportunity for ward members to give an opposing vote.

As an exception, new stake officers may need to begin their service before the next stake conference or stake general priesthood meeting in which they would normally be sustained. When this occurs, they should be sustained in the sacrament meetings of the wards and branches of the stake. These sustainings should be kept to a minimum. Members of the stake presidency or high council present the sustainings.

In unusual circumstances, stake members may need to begin service in a calling before they can be presented for a sustaining vote in a general stake meeting or in sacrament meetings. When this occurs, a member of the stake presidency or high council presents them for a ratifying vote as soon as reasonable. This includes providing an opportunity for members to give an opposing vote.

## 30.4 Setting Apart Officers and Teachers

See [18.11](18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings.md#1811-setting-apart-members-to-serve-in-callings).

## 30.5 Releasing Members from Church Callings

Releases from Church callings should come by inspiration, except when a person’s change of residence necessitates a release or when a calling is for a specific time period, such as full-time missionary service.

Releases from Church callings are made by the same level of authority that extended the callings. To issue a release, an authorized leader meets with the member personally, informs him or her of the release, and expresses appreciation for the service. The leader also asks the person to return any current, usable materials so they can be given to the successor. Only those who need to know are informed of a release before it is announced publicly.

The same congregation that sustained a person gives a vote of thanks when the person is released. An authorized priesthood officer may say:

“[Name] has been released as [position], and we propose that he [or she] be given a vote of thanks for his [or her] service. Those who wish to express their appreciation may manifest it by the uplifted hand.” No dissenting vote is called for.

When a president or bishop is released, the counselors are released automatically. Others who hold positions in the organization, such as clerks, secretaries, and teachers, are not released automatically.

## 30.6 Calling, Ordaining, and Setting Apart Bishops

The stake presidency recommends brethren to be called or released as bishops. Recommendations should be submitted through Leader and Clerk Resources. A member of the stake presidency, a clerk, or the executive secretary may prepare the recommendation. However, only the stake president may submit it.

When recommending a person to serve as bishop, the stake presidency carefully observes the principles set forth in [1 Timothy 3:2–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/3.2-7?lang=eng#p2). It is not appropriate to solicit recommendations or to conduct surveys among ward members with respect to who might be considered for a call to serve as bishop.

Before a new bishop may be interviewed, called, ordained, or set apart, his recommendation must be approved by the First Presidency. The stake president may extend the calling after he receives written approval from the First Presidency. With this approval, the stake president may also ordain and set apart a bishop after ward members have given a sustaining vote. The approval of the First Presidency is also required before a stake president may release a bishop. The stake president may not assign these responsibilities to a counselor.

If a man who is called as bishop is not a high priest, the stake president ensures that he is ordained a high priest before ordaining him a bishop. If the man was ordained a bishop previously, he needs only to be set apart as bishop of the ward.

After the First Presidency has approved the recommendation of a man to serve as bishop, they authorize a stake president, Area Seventy, or General Authority to ordain him and set him apart. The authorized priesthood officer:

1. Calls the man by his full name.
2. States that he is acting by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
3. Ordains the man a bishop (unless he was previously ordained).
4. Sets him apart to preside over the ward and to be the president of the Aaronic Priesthood and the priests quorum, emphasizing his responsibilities for the Aaronic Priesthood and for young women in the ward.
5. Confers on him all the keys, rights, powers, and authority of the office of bishop, referring specifically to the bishop’s duties as a common judge in Israel and as the presiding high priest in the ward.
6. Gives words of blessing as the Spirit directs.
7. Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.
