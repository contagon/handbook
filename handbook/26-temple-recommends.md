# 26. Temple Recommends

## 26.0 Introduction

Entering the house of the Lord is a sacred privilege. Ward and stake leaders encourage all members to be worthy of and have a current temple recommend even if they do not live near a temple.

Church leaders make every effort to see that all who enter the house of the Lord are worthy to do so (see [Psalm 24:3–5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/24?lang=eng&id=p3-p5#p3)). Authorized priesthood leaders conduct temple recommend interviews and issue temple recommends to members who answer the interview questions appropriately and sincerely (see [26.3](26-temple-recommends.md#263-general-guidelines-for-issuing-temple-recommends)). The Lord promises that if those who enter His house are clean, His presence will be there (see [Doctrine and Covenants 97:15–16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97?lang=eng&id=p15-p16#p15)).

Members ages 8 and older must have a current temple recommend to enter a temple. They must be baptized and confirmed to be eligible to receive a recommend.

Children younger than age 8 who are being sealed to their parents or observing the sealing of their siblings to their parents do not need a recommend (see [27.4.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2741-receiving-a-recommend-for-living-ordinances) and [27.4.5](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2745-who-may-attend-a-sealing-of-children-to-parents)). However, their parents verify their information through Ordinance Preparation in LCR (see [27.1.2](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2712-verifying-records-and-receiving-a-temple-recommend-for-living-ordinances)).

This chapter provides instructions for leaders who issue temple recommends. A bishop counsels with his stake president if he has questions about temple recommends that are not answered in this chapter. The stake president may contact the Office of the First Presidency with questions.

## 26.1 Types of Temple Recommends

A current temple recommend allows a member to enter all temples. Priesthood leaders ensure that members receive the correct recommend for their circumstances. There are three types of recommends:

1. _Temple recommends for proxy baptisms and confirmations._ These recommends are for unendowed members who are performing proxy baptisms and confirmations. They are issued to the member through [Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR)](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). The member may choose to receive either a printed or a mobile recommend.

For more information, see [26.3.1](26-temple-recommends.md#2631-issuing-temple-recommends-for-proxy-baptisms-and-confirmations).
2. _Temple recommend for endowed members._ These recommends are for members who have previously been endowed. They authorize endowed members to participate in all temple ordinances for the deceased. They are issued to a member through [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). The member may choose to receive either a printed or a mobile recommend.

For more information, see [26.3.2](26-temple-recommends.md#2632-issuing-temple-recommends-for-endowed-members).
3. _Temple recommends for living ordinances._ These recommends are for members receiving their own endowment or being sealed to a spouse, parents, or children. They are issued digitally through Ordinance Preparation in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). Priesthood leaders use Ordinance Preparation to submit the completed recommend to the temple where the ordinance will take place.

To enter the temple, members who will be age 12 or older by the end of the year in which the ordinance occurs must also have one of the other two types of recommends in addition to a recommend for living ordinances. If needed, priesthood leaders may issue one of those recommends and the recommend for living ordinances during the same interview. For more information, see [26.3.3](26-temple-recommends.md#2633-issuing-temple-recommends-for-living-ordinances).

For information about temple ordinances for the living, see [chapter 27](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md).

## 26.2 Safeguarding Temple Recommends

### 26.2.1 Priesthood Leaders Safeguarding Temple Recommends

Priesthood leaders who are authorized to have temple recommend books should carefully safeguard them. No other person should have access to them. When the Church updates temple recommend books, leaders destroy the outdated books.

Priesthood leaders also ensure that unauthorized individuals do not have access to temple recommend information in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org).

### 26.2.2 Lost or Stolen Recommends

The bishop asks members to notify him as soon as possible if their recommend is lost or stolen. If the member is still worthy, the bishop or an assigned counselor or clerk logs in to [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) to reprint the recommend. The new recommend will expire on the same date as the original.

Sometimes a member whose recommend is lost or stolen is no longer living the standards of worthiness. In these cases, the bishop cancels the recommend immediately (see [26.2.3](26-temple-recommends.md#2623-recommend-holders-who-are-not-living-the-standards-of-worthiness)).

### 26.2.3 Recommend Holders Who Are Not Living the Standards of Worthiness

If the bishop determines that a member who has a current recommend is not living the standards of worthiness (see [26.3](26-temple-recommends.md#263-general-guidelines-for-issuing-temple-recommends)), he uses LCR to cancel the recommend. If this system is not available, the bishop contacts the temple office to have the recommend canceled. If the member has a printed recommend, the bishop requests it from the member.

## 26.3 General Guidelines for Issuing Temple Recommends

Authorized priesthood leaders conduct interviews before a member can receive a temple recommend. Instructions are in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). Priesthood leaders should issue a recommend only if the member answers the temple recommend questions appropriately.

Temple recommend interviews allow members to demonstrate that they have a testimony and are striving to obey God’s commandments and follow His prophets. Priesthood leaders also affirm, through the interview, that the member is worthy.

See [26.4](26-temple-recommends.md#264-conducting-a-temple-recommend-interview) for information about conducting temple recommend interviews.

### 26.3.1 Issuing Temple Recommends for Proxy Baptisms and Confirmations

Temple recommends for proxy baptisms and confirmations authorize members to participate in baptisms and confirmations for the dead. They are issued to unendowed members who have been baptized and confirmed.

Members who have been previously endowed are not issued a recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations.

Members are eligible for these recommends beginning in January of the year they turn 12. A male Church member must be ordained to a priesthood office before he may receive a temple recommend.

In a ward, the bishop or an assigned counselor interviews unendowed members for temple recommends for proxy baptisms and confirmations. In a branch, only the branch president conducts temple recommend interviews. (For an exception, see [23.6.1](23.md#2361-bishopric).)

The leader conducting the interview follows the guidelines in [26.4](26-temple-recommends.md#264-conducting-a-temple-recommend-interview). Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a parent or another adult to be present.

The leader issues a recommend through [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) if the member is worthy. These recommends require only the signatures of the member and a member of the bishopric or the branch president.

Recommends for proxy baptisms and confirmations are activated in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) by a member of the bishopric or by the branch president.

For information about issuing recommends to members who are preparing to receive their endowment or be sealed to a spouse, parents, or children, see [26.3.3](26-temple-recommends.md#2633-issuing-temple-recommends-for-living-ordinances).

### 26.3.2 Issuing Temple Recommends for Endowed Members

Temple recommends for endowed members authorize members to participate in all temple ordinances for the deceased. They are issued to members who have previously been endowed. (For members receiving their own endowment, see [26.3.3](26-temple-recommends.md#2633-issuing-temple-recommends-for-living-ordinances).)

In a ward, the bishop or an assigned counselor conducts temple recommend interviews and issues recommends. In a branch, only the branch president conducts temple recommend interviews and issues recommends.

The leader conducting the interview follows the guidelines in [26.4](26-temple-recommends.md#264-conducting-a-temple-recommend-interview). Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a spouse, parent, or another adult to be present.

The leader issues a recommend through LCR if the member is worthy.

After the interview by a member of the bishopric or the branch president, a member of the stake presidency interviews members who live in a stake. He signs the recommends of those who are worthy. A member of the mission presidency conducts the second interview for members who live in a district. He also signs the recommends of those who are worthy. A district president does not conduct temple recommend interviews unless authorized by the First Presidency.

In stakes, a member of the stake presidency or a stake clerk activates the temple recommend in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). In districts, a member of the mission presidency or a mission clerk activates the recommend.

For information about issuing temple recommends to members who are preparing to receive the endowment or be sealed to a spouse, parents, or children, see [26.3.3](26-temple-recommends.md#2633-issuing-temple-recommends-for-living-ordinances).

### 26.3.3 Issuing Temple Recommends for Living Ordinances

Temple recommends for living ordinances are issued when members are preparing to:

* Receive their own endowment (see [27.2](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#272-the-endowment)).
* Be sealed to a spouse (see [27.3](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#273-sealing-of-husband-and-wife)).
* Be sealed to their parents (see [27.4](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#274-sealing-living-children-to-parents)).
* Have their children sealed to them (see [27.4](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#274-sealing-living-children-to-parents)).

To enter the temple, members who will be age 12 or older by the end of the year in which the ordinance occurs must also have either a recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations or a recommend for endowed members. If needed, priesthood leaders may issue one of those recommends and the recommend for living ordinances during the same interview.

The bishop or branch president and the stake president personally interview members preparing to receive temple ordinances.

In urgent cases when the bishop or stake president is unavailable, he may authorize one of his counselors to conduct these interviews. In a branch, only the branch president may conduct these interviews.

In large young single adult wards and stakes, bishops and stake presidents may authorize experienced counselors to conduct these interviews.

In a district, the mission president or an assigned counselor conducts these interviews. District presidents do not conduct these interviews unless the First Presidency has authorized them to issue temple recommends.

The leader conducting the interview follows the guidelines in [26.4](26-temple-recommends.md#264-conducting-a-temple-recommend-interview). Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a spouse, parent, or another adult to be present.

Before issuing a recommend for living ordinances, the bishop or branch president reviews the member’s record to verify that it does not include a notation about Church membership restrictions. He also reviews the member’s information using Ordinance Preparation in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). He digitally signs the recommend for living ordinances if the member is worthy and prepared to receive temple ordinances. He then submits it to the stake or mission president using Ordinance Preparation in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org).

The stake president or a member of the mission presidency then interviews the member. He digitally signs the recommend if the member is worthy and prepared to receive temple ordinances. He then submits it to the temple using Ordinance Preparation in [LCR](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org). If needed, he also signs the member’s recommend for endowed members (see [26.3.2](26-temple-recommends.md#2632-issuing-temple-recommends-for-endowed-members)).

For information about members preparing to receive temple ordinances, see [27.1.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2711-preparing-to-receive-temple-ordinances) and [27.1.2](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2712-verifying-records-and-receiving-a-temple-recommend-for-living-ordinances).

For information about members preparing to receive the endowment, see [27.2](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#272-the-endowment).

For information about members preparing to be sealed to a spouse, see [27.3](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#273-sealing-of-husband-and-wife).

For information about members preparing to be sealed to parents, see [27.4](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#274-sealing-living-children-to-parents).

See [27.4.5](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2745-who-may-attend-a-sealing-of-children-to-parents) and [38.4.2](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#3842-sealing-children-to-parents) for additional policies on observing sealings and being sealed to parents.

### 26.3.4 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Issuing Temple Recommends to Members in Isolated Areas

Some members live in areas that would require expensive travel or great difficulty to meet with a member of the stake or mission presidency. In these situations, a member of the stake or mission presidency may meet virtually with the member to conduct a temple recommend interview (see [31.4](31.md#314-meeting-with-members-virtually)).

The leader issues the recommend if the member is worthy. If the member requests a printed recommend, a member of the bishopric or the branch president prints the recommend for the member.

This policy also applies to members in the military who are in isolated areas.

## 26.4 Conducting a Temple Recommend Interview

The temple is the house of the Lord. Entering the temple and participating in ordinances there is a sacred privilege. This privilege is reserved for those who are spiritually prepared and striving to live the Lord’s standards, as determined by authorized priesthood leaders.

To make this determination, priesthood leaders interview the member using the questions below. Leaders should not add or remove any requirements. However, they may adapt the questions to the age and circumstances of the member.

Sometimes members have questions during a temple recommend interview. The priesthood leader may explain basic gospel principles. He may also help members understand the temple recommend questions if needed. However, he should not present his personal beliefs, preferences, or interpretations as Church doctrine or policy.

Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a spouse, parent, or another adult to be present.

### 26.4.1 Temple Recommend Interview Questions

1. Do you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?
2. Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as your Savior and Redeemer?
3. Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
4. Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?

Do you sustain the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?

Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the Church?
5. The Lord has said that all things are to be “done in cleanliness” before Him ([Doctrine and Covenants 42:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p41#p41)).

Do you strive for moral cleanliness in your thoughts and behavior?

Do you obey the law of chastity?
6. Do you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private and public behavior with members of your family and others?
7. Do you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine contrary to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?
8. Do you strive to keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at church; attend your meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament; and live your life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?
9. Do you strive to be honest in all that you do?
10. Are you a full-tithe payer?

For new members seeking a recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations: Are you willing to obey the commandment to pay tithing?
11. Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?
12. _(This question is omitted when interviewing a child or youth.)_ Do you have any financial or other obligations to a former spouse or to children?

If yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?
13. _(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)_ Do you keep the covenants that you made in the temple?
14. _(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)_ Do you honor your sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances? (Read the “[Wearing the Temple Garment](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng&id=title_number31-p114#title_number31)” statement, included below, to each member.)
15. Are there serious sins in your life that need to be resolved with priesthood authorities as part of your repentance?
16. Do you consider yourself worthy to enter the Lord’s house and participate in temple ordinances?

### 26.4.2 Wearing the Temple Garment

The First Presidency has provided the following guidance on wearing the garment:

“The garment of the holy priesthood reminds us of the veil in the temple, and that veil is symbolic of Jesus Christ. When you put on your garment, you put on a sacred symbol of Jesus Christ. Wearing it is an outward expression of your inner commitment to follow Him. The garment is also a reminder of your temple covenants. You should wear the garment day and night throughout your life. When it must be removed for activities that cannot reasonably be done while wearing the garment, seek to restore it as soon as possible. As you keep your covenants, including the sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances, you will have greater access to the Savior’s mercy, protection, strength, and power.”

If members have questions about wearing the garment, refer them to [38.5](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#385-temple-clothing-and-garments).

### 26.4.3 Additional Direction

The priesthood leader emphasizes to the member the need to safeguard his or her recommend. It must never be loaned and should be reported immediately to the issuer if lost or stolen.

## 26.5 Issuing Temple Recommends in Special Circumstances

### 26.5.1 Newly Baptized Members

The bishop interviews new members who are old enough to receive a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations (see [26.3.1](26-temple-recommends.md#2631-issuing-temple-recommends-for-proxy-baptisms-and-confirmations)). He conducts this interview soon after the member’s confirmation, normally within a week. For brethren, this interview may be held as part of the interview to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. A bishop or branch president may assign one of his counselors to conduct this interview. Male Church members must be ordained to a priesthood office before receiving a temple recommend.

During the interview, the bishop may offer to use Family Name Assist to help the new member print the name of a deceased family member for whom the new member can perform temple ordinances (see “[Family Name Assist](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/25-temple-and-family-history-work?lang=eng&id=p_j0Z9o#p_j0Z9o)” in 25.4.1).

Worthy adult members may receive their own endowment one full year after being confirmed a member of the Church (see [27.2.1.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#27211-newly-baptized-members)). Priesthood leaders ensure that the date the member will receive the endowment will be at least one full year after his or her confirmation date, not the baptismal date. Only the First Presidency may authorize exceptions.

### 26.5.2 Young Missionaries Returning from Service Away from Home

Before a young missionary serving away from home completes his or her service, the mission president conducts a temple recommend interview. If the missionary is worthy, he issues a recommend. The mission president dates and activates the recommend so it expires three months from the date the missionary returns home.

The bishop interviews returned missionaries to issue a new temple recommend near the end of the three-month expiration period. In urgent cases when the bishop is unavailable, he may authorize one of his counselors to conduct these interviews.

In large young single adult wards, bishops may authorize experienced counselors to conduct these interviews.

Returned missionaries then meet with a member of their stake presidency for a temple recommend interview.

In these temple recommend interviews, the bishop and member of the stake presidency also review counsel given in the missionary’s release interview (see [24.8.2](24.md#2482-missionary-release-interview)). They discuss the returned missionary’s progress, well-being, and current Church calling. They also encourage him or her to continue on a lifelong path of spiritual growth and service.

If the returned missionary does not have a Church calling, the bishop and stake president make certain that one is extended. Returned missionaries may be recommended to serve as temple workers if a temple is nearby (see [25.5](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#255-recommending-and-calling-temple-workers)).

### 26.5.3 Members Who Have Not Lived in the Same Ward for at Least One Year

If a member has not lived in the same ward continuously for at least one year, the bishop reviews the member’s record to verify that it does not include a notation about Church membership restrictions.

The bishop or an assigned counselor contacts the prior bishop before conducting a temple recommend interview. If a counselor learns that there is confidential information, he ends the conversation. He informs his bishop to contact the prior bishop before an interview.

### 26.5.4 After Divorce, Separation, or Annulment

The bishop and stake president may feel impressed to interview a member who has been divorced or legally separated or had a marriage annulled since last receiving a temple recommend. During this interview, they help strengthen the member spiritually. They also verify the member’s continued temple worthiness.

### 26.5.5 Members Whose Close Relatives Publicly Oppose the Church or Belong to Apostate Groups

Bishops and their counselors should be sensitive when issuing recommends to members whose close relatives publicly oppose the Church or belong to apostate groups. Members in these circumstances should not be made to feel that they cannot have a temple recommend because of their family associations. They should be encouraged to maintain a loving relationship with close relatives. They may be issued a temple recommend if they answer all temple recommend questions appropriately and sincerely.

### 26.5.6 Individuals Who Identify as Transgender

Temple ordinances are received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. Worthy members who do not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from their biological sex at birth may receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances. (For a definition of social transition, see [38.6.23](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38623-individuals-who-identify-as-transgender).)

Members who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances.

Bishops counsel with the stake president to address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. Stake and mission presidents seek counsel from the Area Presidency.

For more information, see [38.6.23](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38623-individuals-who-identify-as-transgender).

### 26.5.7 Members Who Have Committed a Serious Sin

A member who has committed a serious sin may not receive a temple recommend until he or she has repented (see [32.6](32-repentance-and-membership-councils.md#326-severity-of-the-sin-and-church-policy)). The period between the sin and the issuing of a recommend is left to the discretion of the bishop and stake president. It should be sufficient to determine that the person has genuinely repented.

### 26.5.8 Members Who Have Been Readmitted after Church Membership Withdrawal or Resignation

#### 26.5.8.1 Members Who Were Not Previously Endowed

After a member who was not previously endowed has been readmitted by baptism and confirmation, the bishop may interview him or her to receive a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations (see [26.4.2](26-temple-recommends.md#2642-wearing-the-temple-garment)). This interview normally takes place within one week of the member’s confirmation. Male Church members must be ordained to an office in the priesthood before receiving a temple recommend.

These members may not be issued recommends to receive their own endowment until one full year after the date of their readmission to the Church by baptism and confirmation.

#### 26.5.8.2 Members Who Were Previously Endowed

Members who were previously endowed may not receive any kind of temple recommend until their temple blessings are restored through the ordinance of restoration of blessings (see [32.17.2](32-repentance-and-membership-councils.md#32172-restoration-of-blessings)). When their blessings are restored, they may be issued a temple recommend for endowed members.
