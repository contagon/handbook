# 8. Elders Quorum

## 8.1 Definition and Purposes of the Melchizedek Priesthood

The priesthood is the power and authority of God. It is conferred upon worthy male members of the Church. Those who hold priesthood keys direct the administration of the ordinances of the gospel, the preaching of the gospel, and the government of the kingdom of God on the earth.

The Melchizedek Priesthood holds “the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church” ([Doctrine and Covenants 107:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.18?lang=eng#p18)).

For more information about the purposes of the priesthood and priesthood keys, see [chapter 3](3-priesthood-principles.md).

### 8.1.1 Melchizedek Priesthood Offices and Duties

The offices in the Melchizedek Priesthood are elder, high priest, patriarch, Seventy, and Apostle. Each priesthood office has rights and responsibilities of service, including authority to administer priesthood ordinances. This chapter contains information for leaders of elders and high priests. For information about ordination to the offices of elder and high priest, see [18.10](18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings.md#1810-conferring-the-priesthood-and-ordaining-to-an-office).

#### 8.1.1.1 Elder

Worthy brethren may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained elders when they are at least 18 years old. The rights and responsibilities of elders are revealed in [Doctrine and Covenants 20:38–45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.38-45?lang=eng#p38); [42:44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.44?lang=eng#p44); [46:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.2?lang=eng#p2); [107:11–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.11-12?lang=eng#p11). Elders also hold the authority of deacons, teachers, and priests.

#### 8.1.1.2 High Priest

Brethren are ordained high priests when they are called to a stake presidency, high council, or bishopric or when otherwise determined by the stake president. The rights and responsibilities of high priests are to preside and to hold all the authority of elders (see [Doctrine and Covenants 107:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.10?lang=eng#p10)).

Brethren in districts are not ordained to the office of high priest.

### 8.1.2 Melchizedek Priesthood Quorums

A priesthood quorum is an organized group of brethren. The primary purposes of quorums are to serve others, build unity and brotherhood, and instruct members in doctrine, principles, and duties.

Apostles and Seventies are organized into quorums at the general Church level.

Each stake has one high priests quorum. The stake presidency is the presidency of that quorum. Members of that quorum are the high priests who currently serve in the following callings: the stake president and his counselors, bishops in the stake and their counselors, high councilors, and functioning patriarchs. Clerks, executive secretaries, and branch presidencies are not members of the high priests quorum.

On Sundays, members of the high priests quorum meet with the elders quorum if they are not assigned elsewhere.

Each ward has one or more elders quorums. The elders quorum includes all elders and prospective elders in the ward. It also includes high priests who are not currently serving in the following callings: the stake president and his counselors, the bishop and his counselors, high councilors, and functioning patriarchs. Members of the elders quorum﻿—whether elders, Seventies, or high priests﻿—retain their current priesthood office.

Members of temple, mission, and missionary training center presidencies are members of their ward elders quorum.

If a ward has an unusually large number of active Melchizedek Priesthood holders, the stake presidency may organize an additional elders quorum (see [Doctrine and Covenants 107:89](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.89?lang=eng#p89)). In such instances, each quorum should have a balance in age, experience, and priesthood office and strength.

Elders are ordained high priests when they are called to serve as a stake president or one of his counselors, as a bishop or one of his counselors, on the high council, or at other times as recommended by the bishop and approved by the stake president.

## 8.2 Stake Melchizedek Priesthood Leadership

### 8.2.1 Stake Presidency

The stake president is the presiding high priest in the stake. He and his counselors comprise the stake high priests quorum presidency.

The stake president oversees the conferral of the Melchizedek Priesthood and ordinations to the offices of elder and high priest (see [18.10](18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings.md#1810-conferring-the-priesthood-and-ordaining-to-an-office)).

The stake president calls an elder or a high priest in each ward to be the elders quorum president. Before calling a new elders quorum president, the stake president consults with the bishop of the ward. The bishop may recommend whom to call.

The stake president, an assigned counselor, or an assigned high councilor calls counselors in the elders quorum presidency. The elders quorum president, in consultation with the bishop, may recommend counselors. He may recommend either high priests or elders as counselors.

All recommendations for calling members of elders quorum presidencies require the approval of the stake presidency and high council.

After a new elders quorum president or a counselor in an elders quorum presidency is called, a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor presents him in sacrament meeting for a sustaining vote of ward members. Those who serve in other elders quorum callings, including secretary, are called by a member of the quorum presidency, with the bishop’s prior approval (see [8.3.3–5](8-elders-quorum.md#833-elders-quorum-secretary)). A member of the quorum presidency presents them in a quorum meeting for a sustaining vote.

The stake president sets apart a new elders quorum president and confers the keys of his calling. A member of the stake presidency or high council sets apart counselors to the elders quorum president.

For information about elders quorum callings in branches in missions, see the [Chart of Callings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng¶=title_number13-figure12_note4_p1#title_number13) (30.7).

### 8.2.2 High Councilors

Under the direction of the stake presidency, high councilors help oversee the work of the Church in the stake. Their responsibilities relating to elders quorums are described in [5.3.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/5-stake-leadership?lang=eng¶=title_number17-p65#title_number17).

## 8.3 Ward Melchizedek Priesthood Leadership

This chapter focuses on administering the elders quorum in a way that strengthens individuals and families. Melchizedek Priesthood leaders should frequently review [chapter 4](4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ.md), which outlines general principles of leadership.

### 8.3.1 Bishopric

The bishop is the presiding high priest in the ward. He and his counselors work closely with the elders quorum president in watching over quorum members and their families, building strength in the quorum, and ensuring that the work of the priesthood is accomplished.

The elders quorum president is directly responsible to the stake presidency. However, the bishop, as the presiding high priest in the ward, also meets regularly with the elders quorum president. The bishop counsels with him and gives direction about how to serve and bless ward members, working in harmony with all ward organizations. The bishop asks him to report on his responsibilities, including the efforts of ministering brothers.

### 8.3.2 Elders Quorum Presidency

The elders quorum presidency presides over, sits in council with, and teaches quorum members (see [Doctrine and Covenants 107:89](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.89?lang=eng#p89)). They direct the efforts of the quorum to advance the work of salvation in the ward (see [chapter 1](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md)). The bishop may assign them to lead member missionary work and temple and family history work in the ward (see [1.2.3](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#123-inviting-all-to-receive-the-gospel); [1.2.4](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#124-uniting-families-for-eternity)). The bishop may also assign the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies to lead activation and convert retention efforts in the ward (see [6.1.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/6-ward-leadership?lang=eng¶=title_number5-p21#title_number5)). They receive instruction from the stake presidency, assigned members of the high council, and the bishop.

#### 8.3.2.1 Elders Quorum President

The elders quorum president has the following responsibilities:

* He serves as a ward officer and member of the ward council. As a member of this council, he participates in efforts to build faith and strengthen individuals and families (see [chapter 2](2-supporting-individuals-and-families.md)).
* He teaches quorum members their duties, using this handbook as a resource.
* In consultation with the bishop, he submits recommendations for brethren to be called to serve as counselors in the elders quorum presidency. He also submits recommendations to the bishop for brethren to be called to serve as secretaries, as teachers, and in other elders quorum callings. In making these recommendations, he follows the guidelines in [30.1.1](30-callings-in-the-church.md#3011-general-guidelines) and [30.1.2](30-callings-in-the-church.md#3012-recommendations-and-approvals-for-callings).
* He oversees the records, reports, budget, and finances of the quorum. The quorum secretary helps with this responsibility.
#### 8.3.2.2 Elders Quorum President and Counselors

The elders quorum presidency has the following responsibilities. The elders quorum president assigns his counselors to oversee some of these responsibilities. No more than two counselors may be called.

* They encourage quorum members to fulfill their priesthood duties, especially their duties as husbands and fathers. Quorum leaders fulfill this responsibility during quorum meetings and during interviews and visits with quorum members.
* They coordinate ministering with the Relief Society presidency, organize and oversee the work of ministering brothers, and hold ministering interviews (see [chapter 21](21-ministering.md)).
* They oversee efforts to improve gospel learning and teaching in the elders quorum. In these efforts, they follow the principles in [17.3](17-teaching-the-gospel.md#173-leaders-responsibilities).
* The bishop may assign them to lead member missionary work and temple and family history work in the ward (see [25.4.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2541-elders-quorum-presidency-and-ward-temple-and-family-history-leader)). Generally, the elders quorum president delegates these assignments to his counselors. When assigned these responsibilities, the member of the elders quorum presidency who leads member missionary work acts in the role of ward mission leader or supervises a ward mission leader. Similarly, another member of the presidency acts as the ward temple and family history leader or supervises a Melchizedek Priesthood holder who is called to that responsibility. These brethren may be invited to attend ward council meetings as needed.
* They hold elders quorum presidency meetings.
* Under the direction of the bishop and working with the Relief Society presidency, they plan ways to address welfare needs in the quorum and to provide compassionate service (see [8.5](8-elders-quorum.md#85-welfare) and [chapter 22](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md)).
* They visit or interview quorum members at least once a year. They discuss priesthood duties and the well-being of the priesthood holder and his family. This visit or interview should not be combined with a ministering interview in which a companion is present.
* They may organize quorum members to carry out the work of the quorum and to fulfill assignments given in ward council meeting (see [8.3.5](8-elders-quorum.md#835-other-elders-quorum-callings)).
* They help prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood (see [8.6](8-elders-quorum.md#86-prospective-elders)).
* With approval from the bishop, they may occasionally plan activities. These activities should comply with the guidelines in [chapter 20](20-activities.md) and should be coordinated with the ward council.
* As assigned by the bishop, they work with parents and Aaronic Priesthood quorum advisers to help 17- and 18-year-old young men prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and progress from the priests quorum to the elders quorum.
* The elders quorum president assigns one of his counselors to coordinate the quorum’s efforts with the young single adult men in the ward. If the ward has a young single adult committee, this counselor serves on the committee. (See [14.3.3](14-single-members.md#1433-ward-leadership) and [14.3.4](14-single-members.md#1434-ward-young-single-adult-committee).)
### 8.3.3 Elders Quorum Secretary

With the bishop’s approval, the elders quorum president or one of his counselors calls and sets apart an elder or a high priest to serve as elders quorum secretary. The quorum secretary has the following responsibilities:

* He consults with quorum leaders to prepare agendas for presidency meetings. He attends these meetings, takes notes, and keeps track of assignments.
* He may schedule ministering interviews for the elders quorum president and his counselors.
* Each quarter, he compiles a report of quorum meeting attendance and ministering interviews held. He reviews this report with the elders quorum president and submits it to the ward clerk.
* If the quorum plans activities that will involve expenses, the secretary helps leaders prepare an annual budget and account for expenses.
### 8.3.4 Elders Quorum Teachers

With the bishop’s approval, the elders quorum president or one of his counselors may call and set apart one or more elders or high priests to serve as elders quorum teachers.

Quorum leaders assign them to teach doctrine and lead discussions during priesthood meeting. Leaders also encourage them to attend teacher council meetings (see [17.7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/17-teaching-the-gospel?lang=eng¶=title_number44-p189#title_number44)). Teachers follow the principles outlined in [17.4](17-teaching-the-gospel.md#174-teacher-council-meetings).

### 8.3.5 Other Elders Quorum Callings

The callings in this section are optional. The bishop and elders quorum president may decide that these positions are not needed, or they may feel that additional callings are needed. The elders quorum presidency recommends brethren to serve in these callings. With the bishop’s approval, the elders quorum president or one of his counselors extends these callings.

#### 8.3.5.1 Assistant Secretaries and Ministering Secretaries

The elders quorum presidency may call one or more assistant secretaries to help with secretary responsibilities (see [8.3.3](8-elders-quorum.md#833-elders-quorum-secretary)). Prospective elders may serve as assistant secretaries.

If the presidency needs additional help organizing ministering interviews and preparing the quarterly report (see [chapter 21](21-ministering.md)), they may counsel with the bishop about calling one or more ministering secretaries. Ministering secretaries do not conduct ministering interviews. Prospective elders may serve as ministering secretaries.

#### 8.3.5.2 Service Coordinator and Assistants

As needed, the elders quorum presidency may call a quorum member to coordinate service. Assistants may also be called.

#### 8.3.5.3 Activity Coordinator and Assistants

As needed, the elders quorum presidency may call a quorum member to coordinate activities that are not held on Sunday. Assistants may also be called.

#### 8.3.5.4 Other Callings and Assignments

As needed, the elders quorum presidency may call or assign quorum members to help accomplish the work of salvation. For example, they may counsel with the bishop about calling members to assist with strengthening young single adults, doing temple and family history work, and sharing the gospel. Brethren with short-term assignments do not need to be called and set apart. Brethren who lead or serve in long-term assignments are called and set apart by a member of the elders quorum presidency.

## 8.4 Ministering

See [chapter 21](21-ministering.md).

## 8.5 Welfare

Welfare is central to the work of the elders quorum.

Under the bishop’s direction, the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies share the following welfare responsibilities:

* They teach principles of temporal and spiritual self-reliance.
* They care for the poor and needy and encourage members to give service.
* They help individuals and families become self-reliant and find solutions to short-term and long-term welfare concerns.

For more information on these welfare responsibilities, see [chapter 22](22-providing-for-temporal-needs.md).

## 8.6 Prospective Elders

A prospective elder is a male Church member age 19 or older who does not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Married brethren who are younger than 19 and do not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood are also prospective elders.

### 8.6.1 Responsibility for Prospective Elders

The elders quorum presidency helps prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.

These leaders assign dedicated ministering brothers to prospective elders. If prospective elders have been ordained to the office of teacher or priest, leaders may assign them to serve as ministering brothers.

Elders quorum leaders invite prospective elders to attend quorum meetings and activities.

### 8.6.2 Helping Prospective Elders Prepare to Receive the Melchizedek Priesthood

Helping prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood should be among leaders’ highest priorities because it strengthens families and prepares couples for temple marriage. Prospective elders should be ordained as soon as they are reasonably prepared, without unnecessary waiting periods.

The elders quorum president ensures that prospective elders are taught the following principles in preparation to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood:

* The restoration of the priesthood and priesthood keys through the Prophet Joseph Smith
* The oath and covenant of the priesthood (see [Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33-44?lang=eng#p33))
* The responsibilities of husbands and fathers
* The duties of an elder and the purposes of priesthood quorums
* The purposes of priesthood ordinances and blessings and how to perform those ordinances and blessings (see [chapter 18](18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings.md) and the [Family Guidebook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/family-guidebook?lang=eng))

Leaders may teach these principles one-on-one, or they may organize a class held outside of regular Sunday meetings for prospective elders in the ward, in multiple wards, or in the stake. They may assign ministering brothers to help provide this instruction. They may also offer the instruction as part of a temple preparation course (see [25.5.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2551-temple-preparation-course)). As needed, the stake president may assign a member of the high council to help elders quorum leaders with this responsibility.

Resources to help prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood may include the following:

* Doctrine and Covenants [sections 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng), [84](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng), [107](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng), and [121](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng)
* [Family Guidebook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/family-guidebook?lang=eng)
* Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood, Part A, [lessons 1–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-a/history-and-organization-of-the-priesthood/lesson-1-the-priesthood?lang=eng) and [9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-a/history-and-organization-of-the-priesthood/lesson-9-duties-of-the-elder-and-the-high-priest?lang=eng)
* Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood, Part B, [lessons 1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-1-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng)

The bishop counsels with the elders quorum presidency and with the ward council to identify prospective elders who should have the highest priority for receiving this preparation. Eighteen-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holders who have not otherwise been prepared may be included.

In helping a prospective elder prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, the bishop follows the instructions in [38.2.5.1](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38251-melchizedek-priesthood-offices).

## 8.7 Leadership Meetings

### 8.7.1 Ward Council Meeting

The elders quorum president serves as a member of the ward council (see [chapter 7](7.md)).

### 8.7.2 Elders Quorum Presidency Meeting

The elders quorum presidency holds a presidency meeting regularly. The quorum president presides at the meeting and conducts it. The quorum secretary attends, takes notes, and keeps track of assignments. A high councilor assigned to the ward may attend periodically.

The agenda may include the following items:

1. Plan ways to strengthen quorum members and their families, including prospective elders.
2. Read and discuss scripture passages and instructions from Church leaders that relate to the responsibilities of priesthood leaders.
3. Discuss the temporal and spiritual needs of individuals and families, and plan ways to help meet those needs.
4. Review information from ministering interviews about efforts to watch over and minister to individuals and families in the ward. Discuss ministering assignments and efforts, and adjust them as needed. Plan how to improve.
5. Discuss efforts related to missionary work and temple and family history work in the ward. Plan ways to accomplish this work.
6. Plan quorum meetings, and discuss ways to improve them.
7. Review attendance records, and discuss ways to encourage participation in quorum meetings.
8. Review counsel and assignments from the bishop, the ward council, and the stake presidency. Plan ways to follow the counsel and fulfill the assignments.
9. Plan ways to build quorum unity, including service and other quorum activities.
### 8.7.3 Stake Priesthood Leadership Meeting

The stake presidency convenes a stake priesthood leadership meeting in connection with each stake conference (see [29.3.1, number 2](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#2931-stake-conference)). The presidency also convenes one other stake priesthood leadership meeting during the year, for a total of three such meetings annually. Elders quorum presidencies and secretaries attend.

## 8.8 Quorum Meetings

### 8.8.1 Elders Quorum Meetings

Elders quorum meetings are held on the second and fourth Sundays of each month. They last 50 minutes. The purposes of these meetings are to conduct business, learn priesthood duties, strengthen individuals and families, study the gospel of Jesus Christ, counsel together, and organize to meet local needs. Leaders prayerfully plan the meetings to accomplish these purposes.

Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood holders do not meet together for opening exercises but gather in their respective quorum meetings.

The elders quorum president presides over the meeting unless a person who presides over him is present. A member of the quorum presidency conducts.

Quorum meetings begin with a brief welcome, a reminder of the [Come, Follow Me﻿—For Individuals and Families](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/come-follow-me/individuals-and-families) home study materials for that day and the following week, and any quorum business. The remainder of the meeting is used for gospel instruction and discussion.

Lessons in quorum meetings focus on messages from the most recent general conference.

First-Sunday council meetings are discontinued. However, as needed, elders quorums may use part of a Sunday meeting to counsel about a specific topic.

Members of the stake high priests quorum meet with the elders quorum if they are not assigned elsewhere. In addition, the bishop may invite an 18-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holder to meet with the elders quorum (see [8.6.2](8-elders-quorum.md#862-helping-prospective-elders-prepare-to-receive-the-melchizedek-priesthood)).

Elders quorum meetings do not begin with a hymn or prayer, but they conclude with a prayer. Hymns may be used to enhance a lesson as appropriate.

### 8.8.2 Stake High Priests Quorum Meeting

The stake presidency convenes a high priests quorum meeting for all high priests in the quorum at least once a year. During this meeting they teach quorum members the doctrine of the gospel (see [Alma 13:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.1-6?lang=eng#p1)), instruct them in their duties, and conduct quorum business. An annual meeting of all ordained high priests in the stake is no longer held.

## 8.9 Teaching How to Perform Ordinances and Blessings

The following publications provide instructions on performing ordinances and blessings:

1. [Chapter 18](18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings.md) in this handbook
2. Family Guidebook, [pages 18–25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/family-guidebook/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng)
3. Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood, Part B, [pages 42–47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng¶=title8-p87#title8)

Using these publications, priesthood leaders teach brethren how to perform ordinances and blessings. Leaders ensure that each priesthood holder has the [Family Guidebook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/family-guidebook?lang=eng) or [Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood, Part B](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b?lang=eng), so he can have his own copy of these instructions.

Leaders should not produce or use other publications that give instructions for ordinances, blessings, or prayers unless the First Presidency has authorized such publications.

## 8.10 Additional Guidelines and Policies

### 8.10.1 Brethren Who Have Special Needs

Brethren who may have special needs include those who are ill, elderly, widowed, divorced, homebound, or bereaved and those who care for chronically ill family members. Members of the elders quorum should offer help.

Brethren who have these and other special challenges may come to their elders quorum president with their concerns. He should listen, offer love and encouragement, and maintain confidentiality. If he learns of possible concerns with worthiness or sensitive family matters, he refers the person to the bishop.

For information about helping brethren with disabilities, see [38.8.31](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38831-members-with-disabilities) and [disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).

### 8.10.2 Offering Support at Times of Death

When a death occurs in the ward, the bishop may ask the elders quorum president to contact the family to give comfort, assess needs, and offer assistance. He may request similar assistance from the Relief Society president. Elders quorum and Relief Society leaders coordinate these efforts.

The bishop may also ask elders quorum leaders to help make preparations for the funeral service. For additional information about funerals, see [29.6](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#296-funerals-and-other-services-at-a-time-of-death).

If possible, deceased members who were endowed should be buried in temple clothing. In some circumstances, the bishop may ask the elders quorum president to assign an endowed man to dress or oversee the proper dressing of a deceased endowed man. These leaders ensure that the assignment is given to a person who will not find it objectionable. For additional instructions on dressing deceased members in temple clothing, the bishop may refer to [27.3.9](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#2739-temple-burial-clothing).

The elders quorum president, ministering brothers, and other brethren continue to offer support, comfort, and assistance to the bereaved during the period of adjustment following the death.

### 8.10.3 Instructions about Temple Clothing and Garments

See [38.8.49](38-church-policies-and-guidelines.md#38849-temple-clothing-and-garments).

### 8.10.4 Funding for Activities

See [20.2.8](20-activities.md#2028-funding-for-activities).
