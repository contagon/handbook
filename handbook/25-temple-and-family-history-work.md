# 25. Temple and Family History Work in the Ward and Stake

## 25.0 Introduction

The temple is the house of the Lord. Temple ordinances and covenants bless Heavenly Father’s children. Heavenly Father invites all His children to qualify for and receive temple ordinances.

Uniting families for eternity is part of God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see [1.2](1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation.md#12-gods-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation)). Temple and family history work is the means for uniting and sealing families for eternity (see [Matthew 16:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)). This work includes:

* Making covenants as we receive our own temple ordinances (see [Isaiah 55:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/55?lang=eng&id=p3#p3); [Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p19-p23#p19)).
* Discovering our deceased ancestors and performing ordinances for them in the temple so they can make covenants with God (see [Malachi 4:5–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/4?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5); [1 Corinthians 15:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p29#p29); [Doctrine and Covenants 128:15–18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p15-p18#p15)).
* Going to the house of the Lord regularly, where possible, to worship God and perform ordinances for our ancestors (see [Luke 24:52–53](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/24?lang=eng&id=p52-p53#p52); [Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13)).

This chapter guides Church leaders and members on how to unite families for eternity through temple and family history work. More information is available at “[Temples](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/temples?lang=eng),” “[Proxy Baptism](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/proxy-baptism?lang=eng),” and “[Family History](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/family-history?lang=eng)” (Topics and Questions, Gospel Library).

## 25.1 Member and Leader Participation in Temple and Family History Work

Church members have the privilege and responsibility to help unite their families for eternity. They prepare themselves to make covenants as they receive temple ordinances. They strive to keep those covenants.

They also help family members understand, receive, and strive to keep temple covenants. Parents have the primary responsibility to help their children experience the blessings of temple and family history service for deceased family members.

Church members are encouraged to identify their deceased relatives who have not received temple ordinances. Members then perform the ordinances on behalf of those relatives (see [Doctrine and Covenants 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)). In the spirit world, deceased individuals can choose to accept or reject the ordinances that have been performed for them.

Members also invite family and friends to learn about their ancestors and discover their stories.

Many tools are available to help members in their temple and family history work. Some of these are described in [25.4.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2541-familysearchorg-ordinances-ready-and-familysearch-apps) and [25.4.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2542-my-family-stories-that-bring-us-together).

Church leaders support members in their temple and family history efforts as described in [25.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#252-organizing-temple-and-family-history-work-in-the-ward) and [25.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#253-organizing-temple-and-family-history-work-in-the-stake).

### 25.1.1 Individual Responsibility for Temple Worship

Members determine for themselves when and how often to worship in the temple. Leaders do not establish quotas or reporting systems for temple worship.

Individual members and families who have current temple recommends may attend any temple they desire. They may schedule an appointment with the temple. See [temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples) for each temple’s contact information.

### 25.1.2 Ward and Stake Temple Trips

Each Church unit is assigned to a temple district. Organized ward or stake visits to temples outside the assigned temple district are not encouraged.

All ward and stake temple trips should be scheduled with the temple. See [temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples) for each temple’s contact information.

## 25.2 Organizing Temple and Family History Work in the Ward

Ward leaders have the following responsibilities for temple and family history work in the ward:

* Help individual members prepare to make covenants with God by receiving temple ordinances (see [27.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#271-receiving-temple-ordinances)).
* Encourage members to worship in the house of the Lord as often as their circumstances allow.
* Encourage individuals and families to learn the doctrine and blessings of temple and family history work.
* Ensure that the doctrine and blessings of temple and family history work are taught regularly during Church meetings. This work unites families for eternity.
* Encourage members to learn about their ancestors and perform temple ordinances on their behalf.
* Support parents in helping their children participate in temple and family history work.
* Encourage all youth and adult members, including new members, to have a current temple recommend.

See [chapter 26](26-temple-recommends.md) for information about temple recommends.

### 25.2.1 Bishopric

The bishopric coordinates with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s temple and family history efforts. These leaders counsel together regularly.

The bishopric also has the following additional responsibilities for temple and family history work:

* Coordinate with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s temple and family history work (see [25.2.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2522-elders-quorum-and-relief-society-presidencies)).
* Ensure that temple and family history work is coordinated in ward council and ward youth council meetings.
* Review and approve the ward temple and family history plan (see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan)).
* Oversee the organization of temple preparation courses (see [25.2.8](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2528-temple-preparation-course)).
* Issue temple recommends (see [chapter 26](26-temple-recommends.md)).

[[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) The bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward temple and family history leader (see [25.2.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2523-ao-ward-temple-and-family-history-leader) for more information).

### 25.2.2 Elders Quorum and Relief Society Presidencies

The elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies lead the day-to-day temple and family history efforts in the ward (see [8.2.4](8-elders-quorum.md#824-uniting-families-for-eternity) and [9.2.4](9-relief-society.md#924-uniting-families-for-eternity)). The elders quorum presidency leads these efforts for members of the elders quorum. The Relief Society presidency leads the efforts for members of the Relief Society. They work together to lead these efforts with the ward council, under the coordination of the bishop.

These leaders have the following additional responsibilities:

* Ask a ward temple and family history consultant to help ward members who have recently received mission calls to find and prepare deceased ancestors’ names for temple ordinances.
* Help the ward council develop and implement the ward temple and family history plan (see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan)).
* Ensure that temple and family history work is planned and reported in ward council meetings and in ward temple and family history coordination meetings.
* Lead the work of the ward temple and family history leader. If this leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role (see [25.2.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2523-ao-ward-temple-and-family-history-leader)).

The elders quorum and Relief Society presidents each assign a presidency member to help lead temple and family history work in the ward. These two presidency members work together. They attend ward temple and family history coordination meetings (see [25.2.7](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2527-ward-temple-and-family-history-coordination-meetings)).

### 25.2.3 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Ward Temple and Family History Leader

The bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward temple and family history leader. If they decide to extend this calling, the bishopric counsels with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents in determining whom to call. This person should be a Melchizedek Priesthood holder. If this leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role.

The ward temple and family history leader supports the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies in their temple and family history responsibilities. He also has the following responsibilities:

* Coordinate temple and family history efforts with ward organization leaders, including youth quorum and class presidencies.
* Lead ward temple and family history coordination meetings (see [25.2.7](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2527-ward-temple-and-family-history-coordination-meetings)).
* Attend ward council meetings when invited.
* Help the ward council develop and implement the ward temple and family history plan (see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan)).
* Instruct ward temple and family history consultants. Coordinate their efforts to help members find names of ancestors and perform temple ordinances on their behalf.
* Work with the ward mission leader and the missionaries to help those learning the gospel, new members, and returning members engage in temple and family history work (see [23.2](23.md#232-strengthen-new-members) and [23.3](23.md#233-strengthen-returning-members)).
* [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Where applicable, assign ward temple and family history consultants to serve in the FamilySearch center (see [25.3.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2536-ao-familysearch-centers)).

### 25.2.4 Ward Temple and Family History Consultants

Ward temple and family history consultants serve under the direction of the ward temple and family history leader. The bishopric calls these members to serve. Adults and youth may be called. The elders quorum, Relief Society, and Young Women presidents may suggest who could serve.

Consultants teach others in simple ways how to participate in temple and family history work. They have the following responsibilities:

* Help members prepare to receive temple ordinances and make temple covenants.
* Help members experience the blessings of discovering their ancestors and performing temple ordinances on their behalf. These experiences are especially important for those learning the gospel, new and returning members, and those preparing to receive a recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations.
* Participate in temple and family history coordination meetings (see [25.2.7](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2527-ward-temple-and-family-history-coordination-meetings)).
* Serve in a local FamilySearch center when assigned (see [25.3.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2536-ao-familysearch-centers)).

Resources to help temple and family history consultants are listed in [25.4.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2541-familysearchorg-ordinances-ready-and-familysearch-apps) and [25.4.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2542-my-family-stories-that-bring-us-together).

### 25.2.5 Ward Council

Members of the ward council prayerfully develop and implement a ward temple and family history plan. For information about the plan, see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan).

The bishop may invite the ward temple and family history leader to attend ward council meetings.

### 25.2.6 Ward Temple and Family History Plan

Each ward should have a simple temple and family history plan. This plan helps ward members, including children and youth, prepare to worship in the house of the Lord and participate in family history work as often as their circumstances allow.

The elders quorum and Relief Society presidents help the ward council develop the plan. The ward temple and family history leader also helps. In developing the plan, they:

* Prayerfully consider members’ needs and the available resources.
* Identify actions to take during the year.
* Determine how to implement the plan and make assignments accordingly.

Examples of what the plan might include are listed below:

* Help specific members prepare to receive temple ordinances.
* Help members build their family trees on [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org) or with the [FamilySearch Family Tree app](https://www.familysearch.org/blog/en/mobile) (see [25.4.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2541-familysearchorg-ordinances-ready-and-familysearch-apps)).
* Help members use the Ordinances Ready feature on [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org) or the [FamilySearch Family Tree app](https://www.familysearch.org/blog/en/mobile) to take the name of an ancestor to the temple.
* Involve new and returning members, youth, and children in temple and family history work.

The ward temple and family history plan should not establish quotas or reporting systems for temple worship (see [25.1.1](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2511-individual-responsibility-for-temple-worship)).

The bishop reviews and approves the plan. Members of the ward council take the lead in implementing it. They report on progress in ward council meetings. They also update the plan as needed.

### 25.2.7 Ward Temple and Family History Coordination Meetings

Brief informal ward temple and family history coordination meetings are held regularly. The ward temple and family history leader conducts these meetings.

Others who are invited include:

* Assigned members of the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies.
* An assistant in the priests quorum (or the teachers or deacons quorum president if there are no priests in the ward).
* A presidency member of the oldest Young Women class.
* Temple and family history consultants.

All who attend, including the youth, counsel together as equal participants. The purpose of these meetings is to:

* Coordinate efforts to implement the ward temple and family history plan (see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan)).
* Plan how to help specific ward members prepare to receive temple ordinances.
* Plan how to help specific ward members with their temple and family history work.

These meetings may be held in person or remotely. Coordination can also happen in other ways, including phone calls, texts, and emails.

### 25.2.8 Temple Preparation Course

Under the bishop’s direction, a temple preparation course may be organized to help members prepare to make covenants as they receive temple ordinances. These courses are held outside of regular Sunday meetings at a time convenient for members. They may be held at a meetinghouse or in a home.

Ward council members prayerfully select members to invite to participate in each course. These courses may be especially helpful for the following people:

* New members
* Members preparing to receive their own endowment or to be sealed
* Members returning to Church activity
* Endowed members who have not renewed their temple recommends for an extended time

The bishopric calls one or more temple preparation instructors. Lessons and instructions for organizing the course are in [Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar Teacher’s Manual](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/endowed-from-on-high/introduction?lang=eng). Participants are given copies of [Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng). For personal study and lesson resources, see [temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples).

## 25.3 Organizing Temple and Family History Work in the Stake

Stake leaders support ward leaders and members in their temple and family history efforts.

### 25.3.1 Stake Presidency

The stake president holds the keys for God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the stake. He and his counselors have the following responsibilities for the temple and family history aspect of that work:

* Help members prepare to make sacred covenants as they receive temple ordinances (see [27.1](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#271-receiving-temple-ordinances)).
* Encourage members to worship in the house of the Lord as often as their circumstances allow.
* Ensure that the doctrine and blessings of temple and family history work are taught regularly in stake meetings. This work unites families for eternity.
* Encourage members to learn about their ancestors and perform temple ordinances on their behalf.
* Conduct temple recommend interviews (see [chapter 26](26-temple-recommends.md)).

In his regular meeting with each elders quorum president, a member of the stake presidency discusses temple and family history work in the ward (see [8.3.1](8-elders-quorum.md#831-stake-presidency-and-bishop)). [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) The counselors in the elders quorum presidency and the high councilor assigned to the quorum may attend.

### 25.3.2 Stake Adult Leadership Committee

The stake adult leadership committee includes:

* The stake presidency.
* The stake Relief Society presidency.
* High councilors assigned to work with elders quorums.

These leaders instruct and support elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities for temple and family history work (see [25.2.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2522-elders-quorum-and-relief-society-presidencies)). Instruction could take place in a group setting or individually. Ward temple and family history leaders may be invited to receive this instruction.

For more about this committee’s meetings, see [29.3.8](29-meetings-in-the-church.md#2938-ao-stake-adult-leadership-committee-meeting).

### 25.3.3 High Councilors

The stake presidency may assign high councilors to instruct and support the following people in their responsibilities for temple and family history work:

* Elders quorum presidencies
* Ward temple and family history leaders
* Stake temple and family history consultants
* FamilySearch center coordinators

One or more high councilors may be assigned to lead these efforts. However, all high councilors have these responsibilities for the wards and quorums to which they are assigned.

High councilors may help ward temple and family history leaders instruct ward temple and family history consultants. High councilors may be assisted by stake temple and family history consultants.

The stake presidency may assign a high councilor to coordinate the stake’s family history volunteer efforts (see [25.4.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2543-family-history-volunteer-activities)). He or another high councilor may be assigned to oversee the work in FamilySearch centers (see [25.3.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2536-ao-familysearch-centers)).

### 25.3.4 Stake Relief Society Presidency

Under the direction of the stake president, the stake Relief Society presidency instructs and supports ward Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities for temple and family history work (see [9.2.4](9-relief-society.md#924-uniting-families-for-eternity)).

### 25.3.5 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) Stake Temple and Family History Consultants

Stake temple and family history consultants support temple and family history work throughout the stake. They serve under the direction of the stake presidency and one or more high councilors assigned to temple and family history work.

These consultants support high councilors and the stake Relief Society presidency in their efforts to instruct others in temple and family history work (see [25.3.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2533-high-councilors) and [25.3.4](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2534-stake-relief-society-presidency)). They may also be given the following assignments:

* Help teach and support members in ward temple and family history callings.
* Help coordinate volunteer efforts using [FamilySearch.org](https://familysearch.org) or the [FamilySearch apps](https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/familysearch-mobile-apps) (see [25.4.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2543-family-history-volunteer-activities)).
* Serve in FamilySearch centers (see [25.3.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2536-ao-familysearch-centers)).

### 25.3.6 [[AO]](0-introductory-overview.md#02-adaptation-and-optional-resources) FamilySearch Centers

If resources are available, the stake may organize one or more FamilySearch centers. These centers are to help visitors discover, gather information about, and unite both living and deceased family members through temple ordinances. Anyone is welcome to use these centers.

The stake president calls a FamilySearch center coordinator to oversee efforts in each FamilySearch center. Each center is generally staffed by assigned stake and ward temple and family history consultants. FamilySearch centers should be open at convenient times. FamilySearch centers near temples may adjust their schedules to align with the local temple’s schedule.

As an exception, some large FamilySearch centers are overseen by Area Presidencies.

### 25.3.7 FamilySearch Center Coordinator

The FamilySearch center coordinator organizes the daily operations of the FamilySearch center. He or she serves under the direction of the stake president or an assigned high councilor. Responsibilities may include those listed below:

* Help members prepare family names so they can perform ordinances in the house of the Lord.
* Coordinate the center’s activities to help Church members and community visitors discover their ancestors.
* Work with (1) the high councilor who is assigned to support temple and family history work and (2) the stake technology specialist to meet the center’s operational needs and maintain its resources.

The [FamilySearch Center Operations Guide](https://www.familysearch.org/en/fieldops/article/familysearch-center-operations-guide-2023) provides guidance on how to operate a FamilySearch center.

### 25.3.8 Area Temple and Family History Advisers

Area Presidencies may call area temple and family history advisers. If circumstances allow, one person or one couple can be called for each coordinating council. Advisers typically serve for three to five years.

The Area Presidency may assign Area Seventies to coordinate the work of these advisers in coordinating councils. Advisers’ work should align with the area’s focus.

As directed by the Area Presidency and Area Seventies, advisers help stake presidents fulfill their responsibilities for temple and family history work. Advisers assist stake presidents in teaching people who serve in the following callings about their responsibilities:

* High councilors
* Stake Relief Society presidencies
* Stake adult leadership committees
* Stake temple and family history consultants
* FamilySearch center coordinators

Advisers may be assigned to help stake presidencies prepare members for worship in newly announced temples within the area. Other responsibilities might include instructing stake leaders on the principles and practices of temple and family history work. These include:

* How to help members with their first experience with proxy baptisms and confirmations (see [23.2](23.md#232-strengthen-new-members)).
* How to help members who are preparing to receive their own endowment or be sealed (see [25.2.8](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2528-temple-preparation-course), [27.2](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#272-the-endowment), [27.3](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#273-sealing-of-husband-and-wife), and [27.4](27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living.md#274-sealing-living-children-to-parents)).
* How to organize temple and family history work in the stake and wards (see [25.3](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#253-organizing-temple-and-family-history-work-in-the-stake) and [25.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#252-organizing-temple-and-family-history-work-in-the-ward)).
* How to support elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities (see [25.2.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2522-elders-quorum-and-relief-society-presidencies)).
* How temple and family history work can bless children and youth (see [10.2.4](10-aaronic-priesthood.md#1024-uniting-families-for-eternity), [11.2.4](11-young-women.md#1124-uniting-families-for-eternity), and [12.2.4](12-primary.md#1224-uniting-families-for-eternity)).
* How to help members have a meaningful family history experience (see [Temple and Family History Leadership Instruction](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/handbooks-and-callings/ward-or-branch-callings/temple-and-family-history/leadership-instruction?lang=eng)).
* How to hold effective temple and family history coordination meetings (see [25.2.7](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2527-ward-temple-and-family-history-coordination-meetings)).
* How to help ward leaders plan and set goals (see [25.2.6](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2526-ward-temple-and-family-history-plan)).

## 25.4 Family History Resources

### 25.4.1 FamilySearch.org, Ordinances Ready, and FamilySearch Apps

[FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org) is the Church’s website to help members find and prepare their ancestors’ names for temple ordinances. Ordinances Ready is one feature on [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org) that provides an easy way to receive family or other names to take to the temple.

The site also provides additional resources. These include discovering, sharing, and preserving ancestors’ stories and photographs.

These resources are also available in the [FamilySearch Family Tree app](https://www.familysearch.org/blog/en/mobile) and [FamilySearch Memories app](https://www.familysearch.org/blog/en/mobile). See [FamilySearch apps](https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/familysearch-mobile-apps) for all available apps.

### 25.4.2 My Family: Stories That Bring Us Together

The booklet [My Family: Stories That Bring Us Together](https://store.churchofjesuschrist.org/my-family-stories-that-bring-us-together/5638687353.p) helps people gather and preserve family names and stories. It can also help members begin to prepare family names for temple ordinances.

Physical copies of the booklet can be ordered at [store.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](https://store.churchofjesuschrist.org/my-family-stories-that-bring-us-together/5638687353.p).

### 25.4.3 Family History Volunteer Activities

The “[Get Involved](https://familysearch.org/getinvolved/opportunities)” tab on [FamilySearch.org](https://familysearch.org) allows volunteers to participate in the following activities:

* Indexing, which is a process of entering information from a written historical record into a searchable database on [FamilySearch.org](https://familysearch.org).
* Reviewing records for accuracy.
* Improving the accuracy of Family Tree.

Those who participate in these activities make it possible for others to discover their ancestors and perform temple ordinances on their behalf.

Anyone can participate in volunteer activities on [FamilySearch.org](https://familysearch.org). This can be a particularly fulfilling experience for the following:

* Youth
* Young adults
* Members who are unable to attend Church meetings regularly
* New members
* General public

The stake presidency may assign a stake temple and family history consultant or a high councilor to coordinate this work.

## 25.5 Recommending and Calling Temple Workers

### 25.5.1 Recommending Temple Workers

Potential temple workers are identified in the following ways:

* Members identified by the bishop or another ward leader
* Members who approach the bishop about serving
* Members recommended by the temple president, the matron, or another temple leader
* Members who are preparing for or have recently returned from missionary service (see chapter 24)

The names of potential temple workers are submitted using the [Recommend Temple Worker tool](https://recommendtempleworker.churchofjesuschrist.org). This tool is available to bishops, stake presidents, and temple presidencies. The process for submitting names is outlined below.

When members of a temple presidency identify a potential temple worker, they submit the person’s name to the bishop using the [Recommend Temple Worker tool](https://recommendtempleworker.churchofjesuschrist.org).

When a bishop identifies a potential temple worker or receives a recommendation from a temple president, he counsels with the member about the opportunity to serve. He reviews the requirements for temple workers (see [25.5.2](25-temple-and-family-history-work.md#2552-requirements-for-temple-workers)). If both the bishop and the member feel the opportunity would be appropriate, the bishop completes and submits the recommendation using the [Recommend Temple Worker tool](https://recommendtempleworker.churchofjesuschrist.org). The member should understand that a submitted recommendation does not ensure that he or she will be called or assigned as a temple worker.

The recommendation is next reviewed by the stake president. If the stake president approves the recommendation, he submits it to the temple president for review using the [Recommend Temple Worker tool](https://recommendtempleworker.churchofjesuschrist.org).

Members who are called or assigned as temple workers normally commit to a regular time to serve in the temple each week. Leaders should avoid issuing additional callings that would interfere with members’ ability to serve in the temple.

The [Recommend Temple Worker tool](https://recommendtempleworker.churchofjesuschrist.org) also shows bishops and stake presidents a list of all members from their wards or stakes who currently serve as temple workers.

### 25.5.2 Requirements for Temple Workers

Temple workers help perform ordinances or assist with administrative tasks in the temple. To be recommended as a temple worker, a member must meet the following qualifications:

* Reside in the temple district of the temple where he or she will serve.
* Be endowed, honor temple covenants, and have a current temple recommend.
* Have a strong testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
* Be physically able to administer ordinances without assistance.
* Be worthy of respect in the Church and in the community.
* Work well with other people.
